When the current slows down, its competence (how much it can carry) decreases and the stream deposits the largest particles in the streambed. If current velocity continues to decrease - as a flood wanes, for example - <em><strong>finer particles settle out on top of the large ones</strong></em>. Thus, a stream sorts its sediment according to size. A waning flood might deposit a layer of gravel, <em><strong>overlain</strong></em> by sand and finally topped by silt and clay. Streams also sort sediment in the downstream direction. Many mountain streams <em><strong>are choked with boulders and cobbles</strong></em>, but far downstream, their deltas are composed mainly of fine silt and clay. This downstream sorting is curious because stream velocity generally increases in the downstream direction. Competence increases with velocity, so a river should be able to transport larger particles than its <em><strong>tributaries</strong></em> carry. One explanation for downstream sorting is that <em><strong><u>abrasion wears away the boulders and cobbles to sand and silt</u></strong></em> as the sediment moves downstream over the years. Thus, only the fine sediment reaches the lower parts of most rivers.</p><p>A stream deposits its sediment in three environments: <em><strong>Alluvial fans and deltas</strong></em> form where stream gradient (angle of incline) suddenly decreases as a stream enters a flat plain, a lake, or the sea; <em><strong>floodplain deposits</strong></em> accumulate on a floodplain adjacent to the stream channel; and <em><strong>channel deposits</strong></em> form in the stream channel itself. Bars, which are elongated <em><strong><u>mounds of sediment</u></strong></em>, are <em><strong>transient features</strong></em> that form in the stream channel and on the banks. They commonly form in one year and erode the next. Rivers used for commercial navigation must be recharted frequently because bars shift from year to year. Imagine a winding stream. The water on the outside of the curve moves faster than the water on the inside. The stream erodes its outside bank because the current’s inertia drives it into the outside bank. At the same time, the slower water on the inside point of the bend deposits sediment, forming <em><strong>a point bar</strong></em>. A mid-channel bar is a sandy and gravelly deposit that forms in the middle of a stream channel.</p><p>Most streams flow in a single channel. In contrast, <em><strong>a braided stream</strong></em> flows in many shallow, interconnecting channels. A braided stream forms where more sediment is supplied to a stream than it can carry. The stream dumps the excess sediment, forming mid-channel bars. The bars gradually fill a channel, forcing the stream to overflow its banks and erode new channels. As a result, a braided stream flows simultaneously in several channels and shifts back and forth across its floodplain. <em><strong>Braided streams are common in both deserts and glacial environments because both produce abundant sediment</strong></em>. A desert yields large amounts of sediment because it has little or no vegetation to prevent erosion. Glaciers <em><strong>grind bedrock into fine sediment</strong></em>, which is carried by streams flowing from the melting ice. If a steep mountain stream flows onto a flat plain, its gradient and velocity decrease sharply. As a result, it deposits most of its sediment in a fan-shaped mound called an alluvial fan. <u><em><strong>Alluvial fans are common in many arid and semiarid mountainous regions</strong></em></u>.</p><p>A stream also slows abruptly where it enters the still water of a lake or ocean. The sediment <em><strong>settles out to form</strong></em> a nearly flat <em><strong>landform</strong></em> called a delta. Part of the delta lies above water level, and the remainder lies slightly below water level. Deltas are commonly fan-shaped, resembling the Greek letter “delta” (Δ). Both deltas and alluvial fans change rapidly. Sediment fills channels (waterways), which are then abandoned while new channels develop as in a braided stream. As a result, a stream feeding a delta or fan splits into many channels called distributaries. A large delta may spread out in this manner until it covers thousands of square kilometers. Most fans, however, are much smaller, covering a fraction of a square kilometer to a few square kilometers. The Mississippi River has flowed through seven different delta channels during the past 5,000 to 6,000 years. But in recent years, engineers have built great systems of levees (retaining walls) in attempts <em><strong>to stabilize the channels</strong></em>.</p><h3 id="Materials"><a href="#Materials" class="headerlink" title="Materials"></a>Materials</h3><ul><li>River Erosion: <a href="https://youtu.be/IxlpDWItLPg">https://youtu.be/IxlpDWItLPg</a></li><li>Meadering River Formation: <a href="https://youtu.be/uxjUs_yOHzE">https://youtu.be/uxjUs_yOHzE</a></li><li>Floodplain: <a href="https://youtu.be/ueBwPolRqPo">https://youtu.be/ueBwPolRqPo</a></li><li>Delta formation: <a href="https://youtu.be/mzoPBKTt64Q">https://youtu.be/mzoPBKTt64Q</a> / <a href="https://youtu.be/8fa27da-4BY">https://youtu.be/8fa27da-4BY</a></li><li>Point Bar &amp; Cut Bank: <a href="https://youtu.be/LCcpS_ATpRY">https://youtu.be/LCcpS_ATpRY</a> / <a href="https://youtu.be/gjIrApP2tt8">https://youtu.be/gjIrApP2tt8</a></li><li>Why river move: <a href="https://youtu.be/UBivwxBgdPQ">https://youtu.be/UBivwxBgdPQ</a></li></ul><hr><h2 id="P2-Natufian-Culture"><a href="#P2-Natufian-Culture" class="headerlink" title="P2 - Natufian Culture"></a>P2 - Natufian Culture</h2><h3 id="Overview-🧑🏻‍💻-1"><a href="#Overview-🧑🏻‍💻-1" class="headerlink" title="Overview 🧑🏻‍💻"></a>Overview 🧑🏻‍💻</h3><blockquote><p>Test Date：2023.8.13</p><p>Scores：9/10</p><p>Test Link：<a href="https://toefl.kmf.com/reading/exercise/b1m4hj/169105282496048406/b1m4hj/1">Link🔗</a></p></blockquote><h3 id="Passage-🍉-1"><a href="#Passage-🍉-1" class="headerlink" title="Passage 🍉"></a>Passage 🍉</h3><p><em><strong>In the archaeological record</strong></em> of the Natufian period, from about 12,500 to 10,200 years ago, in the part of the Middle East known as the Levant―roughly east of the <em><strong>Mediterranean</strong></em> and north of the <em><strong>Arabian Peninsula</strong></em>―we see clear evidence of agricultural origins. The stone tools of the Natufians included many <em><strong>sickle-shaped cutting blades</strong></em> that <em><strong><u>show a pattern of wear characteristic of cereal harvesting</u></strong></em>. Also, querns (hand mills) and other stone tools used for processing grain occur in abundance at Natufian sites, and many such tools show signs of long, intensive use . <em><strong><u>Along with the sickle blades are many grinding stones, primarily mortars and pestles of limestone or basalt.</u></strong></em> There is also evidence that these heavy grinding stones were transported over long distances, more than 30 kilometers in some cases, and this is not something known to have been done by people of preceding periods. <em><strong>Fishhooks</strong></em> and <em><strong>weights</strong></em> for sinking fishing nets <em><strong><u>attest to</u></strong></em> the growing importance of fish in the diet in some areas. Stone vessels indicate an increased need for containers, but there is no evidence of Natufian clay working or pottery. Studies of the teeth of Natufians also strongly suggest that these people specialized in collecting cereals and may have been cultivating them and in the process of domesticating them, but they were also still hunter-foragers who intensively hunted <em><strong>gazelle and deer</strong></em> in more lush areas and wild goats and equids in more <em><strong>arid zones</strong></em>.</p><p>The Natufians had a different <em><strong>settlement pattern</strong></em> from that of their predecessors. Some of their <em><strong>base camps</strong></em> were far larger (over 1,000 square meters) than any of those belonging to earlier periods, and they may have lived in some of these camps for half the year or even more. In some of the camps, people made foundations and other architectural elements out of limestone blocks. Trade in shell, obsidian, and other commodities seems to have been on the rise, <em><strong><u>and anthropologists suspect that the exchange of perishables (such as skins, foodstuffs) and salt was also on the increase</u></strong></em>. With the growing importance of wild cereals in the diet, salt probably became for the first time a near necessity: people who eat a lot of meat get many essential salts from this diet, but diets based on cereals can <em><strong>be deficient in</strong></em> salts. Salt was probably also important as a <em><strong>food preservative</strong></em> in early villages.</p><p>As always, there is more to a major cultural change than simply a shift in economics. The Natufians made (and presumably wore) <em><strong>beads and pendants</strong></em> in many materials, including gemstones and marine shells that had to be imported, and it is possible that this ornamentation actually reflects <em><u><strong>a growing sense of ethnic identity</strong></u></em> and perhaps some differences in personal and group status. Cleverly carved <em><strong>figurines of animals</strong></em>, women, and other subjects occur in many sites, and Natufian period cave paintings have been found in Anatolia, Syria, and Iran. More than 400 Natufian <em><strong>burials</strong></em> have been found, most of them simple graves set in house floors. As archaeologist Belfer-Cohen notes, these burials may <em><strong>reflect an ancestor cult</strong></em> and <em><strong><u>a growing sense of community emotional ties and attachment to a particular place</u></strong></em>, and toward the end of the Natufian period, people in this area were <em><strong><u>making a strict separation between living quarters and burial grounds</u></strong></em>. In contrast with the Pleistocene cultures of the Levant, Natufian culture appears to have experienced considerable social change.</p><p>The question of why the Natufians differed from their predecessors in these and other ways and why they made these first steps toward farming as a way of life remains unclear. There were climate changes, of course, and growing aridity and rising population densities may have forced them <em><strong><u>to intensify the exploitation of cereals</u></strong></em>, which in turn might have stimulated the development of sickles and other tools and the permanent communities that make agriculture efficient. But precisely how these factors interacted with others at play is poorly understood.</p><hr><h2 id="P3-Early-Food-Production-in-Sub-Saharan-Africa"><a href="#P3-Early-Food-Production-in-Sub-Saharan-Africa" class="headerlink" title="P3 - Early Food Production in Sub-Saharan Africa"></a>P3 - Early Food Production in Sub-Saharan Africa</h2><h3 id="Overview-🧑🏻‍💻-2"><a href="#Overview-🧑🏻‍💻-2" class="headerlink" title="Overview 🧑🏻‍💻"></a>Overview 🧑🏻‍💻</h3><blockquote><p>Test Date：2023.8.13</p><p>Scores：8/10</p><p>Test Link：<a href="https://toefl.kmf.com/reading/exercise/41m4ij/169105287005914458/41m4ij/1">Link🔗</a></p></blockquote><h3 id="Passage-🍉-2"><a href="#Passage-🍉-2" class="headerlink" title="Passage 🍉"></a>Passage 🍉</h3><p>At the end of the Pleistocene (around 10,000 B.C.), the technologies of food production may have already been employed on the fringes of the rain forests of western and central Africa, where the common use of such root plants as the African yam led people to recognize the advantages of growing their own food. The yam can easily be resprouted if the top is replanted. This primitive form of “vegeculture” (cultivation of root and tree crops) may have been the economic tradition onto which the cultivation of summer rainfall cereal crops was grafted as it came into use south of the grassland areas on the Sahara’s southern borders.</p><p>As the Sahara dried up after 5000 B.C., pastoral peoples (cattle herders) moved southward along major watercourses into the savanna belt of West Africa and the Sudan. By 3000 B.C., just as ancient Egyptian civilization was coming into being along the Nile, they had settled in the heart of the East African highlands far to the south. The East African highlands are ideal cattle country and the home today of such famous cattle-herding peoples as the Masai. The highlands were inhabited by hunter-gatherers living around mountains near the plains until about 3300 B.C., when the first cattle herders appeared. These cattle people may have moved between fixed settlements during the wet and dry seasons, living off hunting in the dry months and their own livestock and agriculture during the rains.</p><p>As was the case elsewhere, cattle were demanding animals in Africa. They required water at least every 24 hours and large tracts of grazing grass if herds of any size were to be maintained. The secret was the careful selection of grazing land, especially in environments where seasonal rainfall led to marked differences in graze quality throughout the year. Even modest cattle herds required plenty of land and considerable mobility. To acquire such land often required moving herds considerable distances, even from summer to winter pastures. At the same time, the cattle owners had to graze their stock in tsetse-fly-free areas. The only protection against human and animal sleeping sickness, a disease carried by the tsetse fly, was to avoid settling or farming such areas- a constraint severely limiting the movements of cattle-owning farmers in eastern and central Africa. As a result, small cattle herds spread south rapidly in areas where they could be grazed. Long before cereal agriculture took hold far south of the Sahara, some hunter-gatherer groups in the savanna woodlands of eastern and southern Africa may have acquired cattle, and perhaps other domesticated animals, by gift exchange or through raids on herding neighbors.</p><p>Contrary to popular belief, there is no such phenomenon as “pure” pastoralists, a society that subsists on its herds alone. The Saharan herders who moved southward to escape drought were almost certainly also cultivating sorghum, millet, and other tropical rainfall crops. By 1500 B.C., cereal agriculture was widespread throughout the savanna belt south of the Sahara. Small farming communities dotted the grasslands and forest margins of eastern West Africa, all of them depending on what is called shifting agriculture. This form of agriculture involved clearing woodland, burning the felled brush over the cleared plot, mixing the ash into the soil, and then cultivating the prepared fields. After a few years, the soil was exhausted, so the farmer moved on, exploiting new woodland and leaving the abandoned fields to lie fallow. Shifting agriculture, often called slash-and-burn, was highly adaptive for savanna farmers without plows, for it allowed cereal farming with the minimal expenditure of energy.</p><p>The process of clearance and burning may have seemed haphazard to the uninformed eye, but it was not. Except in favored areas, such as regularly inundated floodplains, tropical Africa’s soils were of only moderate to low fertility. The art of farming was careful soil selection, that is, knowing which soils were light and easily cultivable, could be readily turned with small hoes, and would maintain their fertility over several years` planting, for cereal crops rapidly remove nitrogen and other nutrients from the soil. Once it had taken hold, slash-and-burn agriculture expanded its frontiers rapidly as village after village took up new lands, moving forward so rapidly that one expert has estimated it took a mere two centuries to cover 2,000 kilometers from eastern to southern Africa.</p>]]></content>

The choice of Memphis by Egypt’s first kings reflects the site’s <em><strong>strategic importance</strong></em>. First, and most obvious, <em><strong><u>the apex of the Nile River delta</u> was <u>a politically opportune location</u> for the state’s administrative center</strong></em>, standing between the united lands of Upper and Lower Egypt and offering ready access to both parts of the country. The older predynastic (pre-3100 B.C.) centers of power, This and Hierakonpolis, were too remote from <em><strong><u>the vast expanse of</u></strong></em> the delta, which had been incorporated into the unified state. Only a city within easy reach of both the Nile valley to the south and <em><strong>the more spread out, difficult terrain</strong></em> to the north could provide the necessary political control that the rulers of early dynastic Egypt (roughly 3000–2600 B.C.) required.</p><p>The region of Memphis must have also served as an important node for <em><strong>transport and communications</strong></em>, even before the unification of Egypt. The region probably acted as a <em><strong>conduit</strong></em> for much, if not all, of the <em><strong>river-based trade</strong></em> between northern and southern Egypt. Moreover, commodities (such as wine, precious oils, and metals) imported from the Near East by the royal courts of predynastic Upper Egypt would have been channeled through the Memphis region on their way south. In short, therefore, <em><strong><u>the site of Memphis offered the rulers of the Early Dynastic Period an ideal location for controlling internal trade within their realm, an essential requirement for a state-directed economy that depended on the movement of goods</u></strong></em>.</p><p>Equally important for the national administration was the ability to control communications within Egypt. <em><strong>The Nile provided the easiest and quickest artery of communication</strong></em>, and the national capital was, again, ideally located <em><strong>in this respect</strong></em>. Recent geological surveys of the Memphis region have revealed much about its <em><strong>topography</strong></em> in ancient times. It appears that the location of Memphis may have been even more advantageous for controlling trade, transport, and communications than was previously appreciated. Surveys and drill cores have shown that the level of the Nile floodplain has steadily risen over the last five <em><strong>millenniums</strong></em>. <em><strong><u>When the floodplain was much lower, as it would have been in predynastic and early dynastic times, the outwash fans (fan-shaped deposits of sediments) of various wadis (stream-beds or channels that carry water only during rainy periods) would have been much more prominent features on the east bank</u></strong></em>. The fan associated with the Wadi Hof extended a significant way into the Nile floodplain, forming a constriction <em><strong>in the vicinity of</strong></em> Memphis. The valley may have narrowed at this point to a mere three kilometers, making it the ideal place for controlling river traffic.</p><p>Furthermore, the Memphis region seems to have been favorably located for the control not only of river-based trade but also of desert trade routes. The two outwash fans in the area gave access to the extensive wadi systems of the eastern desert. In predynastic times, <em><strong><u>the Wadi Digla may have served as a trade route between the Memphis region and the Near East, to judge from the unusual concentration of foreign artifacts found in the predynastic settlement of Maadi.</u></strong></em>  <em><strong><u>Access to, and control of, trade routes between Egypt and the Near East seems to have been a preoccupation of Egypt’s rulers during the period of state formation</u></strong></em>. The desire to monopolize foreign trade may have been one of the primary factors behind the political unification of Egypt. The foundation of the national capital at the junction of an important trade route with the Nile valley is not likely to have been accidental. Moreover, the Wadis Hof and Digla provided the Memphis region with accessible <em><strong>desert pasturage</strong></em>. As was the case with the cities of Hierakonpolis and Elkab, the combination within the same area of both desert pasturage and <em><strong>alluvial arable land</strong></em> (land suitable for growing crops) was a particularly attractive one for early settlement; this combination no doubt contributed to the prosperity of the Memphis region from early predynastic times.</p><h3 id="Materials-📚"><a href="#Materials-📚" class="headerlink" title="Materials 📚"></a>Materials 📚</h3><ul><li>Geograpy of Ancient Egypt:<ul><li><a href="https://youtu.be/jUgZk9HRx1o">https://youtu.be/jUgZk9HRx1o</a></li><li><a href="https://youtu.be/MNM-5qUnkXc">https://youtu.be/MNM-5qUnkXc</a></li></ul></li><li>Ancient Egypt Crash Course: <a href="https://youtu.be/Z3Wvw6BivVI">https://youtu.be/Z3Wvw6BivVI</a></li><li>Nile: <a href="https://youtu.be/gO8V3XGMkME">https://youtu.be/gO8V3XGMkME</a></li></ul><hr><h2 id="P2-Population-Growth-in-Nineteenth-Century-Europe"><a href="#P2-Population-Growth-in-Nineteenth-Century-Europe" class="headerlink" title="P2 - Population Growth in Nineteenth-Century Europe"></a>P2 - Population Growth in Nineteenth-Century Europe</h2><h3 id="Overview-🧑🏻‍💻-1"><a href="#Overview-🧑🏻‍💻-1" class="headerlink" title="Overview 🧑🏻‍💻"></a>Overview 🧑🏻‍💻</h3><blockquote><p>Test Date：2023.8.11</p><p>Scores：9/10</p><p>Test Link：<a href="https://toefl.kmf.com/reading/exercise/f1m3oj/169174321814694387/f1m3oj/1">Link🔗</a></p></blockquote><h3 id="Passage-🍉-1"><a href="#Passage-🍉-1" class="headerlink" title="Passage 🍉"></a>Passage 🍉</h3><p>Because of industrialization, but also because of a vast increase in agricultural output without which industrialization would have been impossible, Western Europeans by the latter half of the nineteenth century enjoyed higher standards of living and longer, healthier lives than most of the world’s peoples. <em><strong>In Europe as a whole</strong></em>, the population rose from 188 million in 1800 to 400 million in 1900. By 1900, virtually every area of Europe had <em><strong>contributed to the tremendous surge of population</strong></em>, but <em><strong><u>each major region was at a different stage of demographic change</u></strong></em>.</p><p>Improvements in the food supply continued trends that had started in the late seventeenth century. <em><strong><u>New lands were put under cultivation, while the use of crops of American origin, particularly the potato, continued to expand</u></strong></em>. Setbacks did occur. Regional agricultural failures were the most common cause of economic recessions until 1850, and they could lead to localized famine as well. A major potato blight (disease) in 1846-1847 led to the deaths of at least one million persons in Ireland and the emigration of another million, <em><strong><u>and Ireland never recovered the population levels the potato had sustained to that point</u></strong></em>. Bad grain harvests at the same time led to increased hardship throughout much of Europe.</p><p>After 1850, however, <em><strong><u>the expansion of foods more regularly kept pace with population growth, though the poorer classes remained malnourished</u></strong></em>. Two developments were crucial. First, the application of science and new technology to agriculture increased. Led by German universities, increasing research was devoted to improving seeds, developing chemical fertilizers, and advancing livestock. After 1861, with the development of <em><strong>land-grant universities</strong></em> in the United States that had huge agricultural programs, American crop-production research added to this mix. <em><strong>Mechanization</strong></em> included the use of horse-drawn harvesters and seed drills, many developed initially in the United States. <em><strong><u>It also included mechanical cream separators and other food-processing devices that improved supply.</u></strong></em></p><p><em><strong><u>The second development involved industrially based transportation</u></strong></em>. With trains and steam shipping, it became possible to move foods to needy regions within Western Europe quickly. <em><strong>Famine</strong></em> (as opposed to malnutrition) became a thing of the past. <em><strong><u>Many Western European countries, headed by Britain, began also to import increasing amounts of food, not only from Eastern Europe, a traditional source, but also from the Americas, Australia, and New Zealand</u></strong></em>. Steam shipping, which improved speed and capacity , as well as <em><strong>new procedures for canning and refrigerating foods</strong></em> (particularly after 1870), was fundamental to these developments.</p><p>Europe’s population growth included one additional innovation by the nineteenth century: <em><strong>it combined with rapid urbanization</strong></em>. More and more Western Europeans moved from countryside to city, and big cities grew most rapidly of all. By 1850, over half of all the people in England lived in cities, a first in human history. In one sense, this pattern seems inevitable : <em><strong><u>growing numbers of people pressed available resources on the land, even when farmwork was combined with a bit of manufacturing</u></strong></em>, so people crowded into cities seeking work or other resources. Traditionally, however, death rates in cities surpassed those in the countryside <em><strong>by a large margin</strong></em>; cities had maintained population only through steady in-migration. Thus rapid urbanization should have reduced overall population growth, but by the middle of the nineteenth century this was no longer the case. Urban death rates remained high, particularly in the <em><strong><u>lower-class slums</u></strong></em>, but they began to decline rapidly.</p><p>The greater reliability of food supplies was a factor in the decline of urban death rates. Even more important were <em><strong>the gains in urban sanitation</strong></em>, as well as measures such as <em><strong>inspection of housing</strong></em>. Reformers, including <em><strong>enlightened doctors</strong></em>, began to study the causes of high death rates and <em><strong>to urge remediation</strong></em>. Even before the discovery of germs, beliefs that disease spread by “miasmas” (noxious forms of bad air) <em><strong><u>prompted attention to sewers and open garbage</u></strong></em>; Edwin Chadwick <em><strong>led an exemplary urban crusade for underground sewers in England in the 1830s</strong></em>. <em><strong><u>Gradually, public health provisions began to cut into customary urban mortality rates</u></strong></em>. By 1900, in some parts of Western Europe <em><strong>life expectancy</strong></em> in the cities began to surpass that of the rural areas. Industrial societies had figured out ways to combine large and growing cities with population growth, a development that would soon spread to other parts of the world.</p><hr><h2 id="P3-Surface-Fluids-on-Venus-and-Earth"><a href="#P3-Surface-Fluids-on-Venus-and-Earth" class="headerlink" title="P3 - Surface Fluids on Venus and Earth"></a>P3 - Surface Fluids on Venus and Earth</h2><h3 id="Overview-🧑🏻‍💻-2"><a href="#Overview-🧑🏻‍💻-2" class="headerlink" title="Overview 🧑🏻‍💻"></a>Overview 🧑🏻‍💻</h3><blockquote><p>Test Date：2023.8.11</p><p>Scores：9/10</p><p>Test Link：<a href="https://toefl.kmf.com/reading/exercise/f1m5ij/169175661153017486/f1m5ij/1">Link🔗</a></p></blockquote><h3 id="Passage-🍉-2"><a href="#Passage-🍉-2" class="headerlink" title="Passage 🍉"></a>Passage 🍉</h3><p>A fluid is a substance, such as a liquid or gas, in which <em><strong>the component particles</strong></em> (usually molecules) can move past one another. Fluids flow easily and <em><strong>conform to</strong></em> the shape of their containers. <em><strong>The geologic processes</strong></em> related to the movement of fluids on a planet’s surface can completely resurface a planet many times. These processes derive their energy from the Sun and the <em><strong>gravitational forces of the planet itsel</strong></em>f. As these fluids interact with surface materials, they <em><strong>move particles about</strong></em> or react chemically with them to modify or produce materials. <strong><u><em>On a solid planet with a hydrosphere the combined mass of water on, under, or above a planet’s surface and an atmosphere, only a tiny fraction of the planetary mass flows as surface fluids</em></u></strong>. Yet the movements of these fluids can drastically alter a planet. Consider Venus and Earth, both <em><strong>terrestrial planets</strong></em> with atmospheres.</p><p>Venus and Earth are commonly regarded as twin planets but not identical twins. They are about the same size, are composed of roughly the same mix of materials, <em><strong><u>and may have been comparably endowed at their beginning with carbon dioxide and water</u></strong></em>. However, the twins evolved differently, largely because of differences in their distance from the Sun. With a significant amount of internal heat, <em><strong><u>Venus may continue to be geologically active with volcanoes, rifting, and folding</u></strong></em>. However, it lacks any sign of <em><strong>a hydrologic system</strong></em> (water circulation and distribution): there are no streams, lakes, oceans, or glaciers. Space probes suggest that Venus may have started with as much water as Earth, but it was unable to keep its water in liquid form. Because Venus receives more heat from the Sun, water released from the interior evaporated and rose to the upper atmosphere where the <em><strong>Sun’s ultraviolet rays</strong></em> broke the molecules apart. <em><strong><u>Much of the freed hydrogen escaped into space, and Venus lost its water</u></strong></em>. Without water, Venus became less and less like Earth and kept an atmosphere filled with carbon dioxide. The carbon dioxide acts as a blanket, creating an intense greenhouse effect and driving surface temperatures high enough to melt lead and to prohibit the formation of <em><strong>carbonate minerals</strong></em>. Volcanoes continually vented more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. On Earth, liquid water removes carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and combines it with calcium, from <em><strong>rock weathering</strong></em>, to form <em><strong>carbonate sedimentary rocks</strong></em>. Without liquid water to remove carbon from the atmosphere, the level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere of Venus remains high.</p><p>Like Venus, Earth is large enough to be geologically active and for its <em><strong>gravitational field</strong></em> to hold an atmosphere. Unlike Venus, it is just the right distance from the Sun so that temperature ranges allow water to exist as a liquid, a solid, and a gas. Water is thus extremely mobile and moves rapidly over the planet in a continuous hydrologic cycle. Heated by the Sun, the water moves in great cycles from the oceans to the atmosphere, over the landscape in river systems, and ultimately back to the oceans. As a result, Earth’s surface has been continually changed and <em><strong>eroded into delicate systems of river valleys</strong></em> - a remarkable contrast to the surfaces of other planetary bodies where impact craters dominate. Few areas on Earth have been untouched by flowing water. <em><strong>As a result, river valleys are the dominant feature of its landscape</strong></em>. Similarly, <em><strong><u>wind action has scoured fine particles away from large areas, depositing them elsewhere as vast sand seas dominated by dunes or in sheets of loess</u></strong></em> (fine-grained soil deposits). These fluid movements are caused by gravity flow systems energized by heat from the Sun. Other geologic changes occur when the gases in the atmosphere or water react with rocks at the surface to form new chemical compounds with different properties. An important example of this process was the removal of most of Earth’s carbon dioxide from its atmosphere to form carbonate rocks. However, if Earth were a little closer to the Sun, its oceans would evaporate; if it were farther from the Sun, the oceans would freeze solid. <em><strong><u>Because liquid water was present, self-replicating molecules of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen developed life early in Earth’s history</u></strong></em> and have radically modified its surface, blanketing huge parts of the continents with greenery. Life thrives on this planet, and it helped create the planet’s oxygen and nitrogen-rich atmosphere and moderate temperatures.</p><h3 id="Materials-📚-1"><a href="#Materials-📚-1" class="headerlink" title="Materials 📚"></a>Materials 📚</h3><ul><li>Liquid: <a href="https://youtu.be/P_jQ1B9UwpU">https://youtu.be/P_jQ1B9UwpU</a></li><li>rifting: <a href="https://youtu.be/_N9JrNjE5qI">https://youtu.be/_N9JrNjE5qI</a></li></ul><hr>]]></content>

The mid-1800s saw a great expansion of American railroads. The major cities east of the <em><strong>Mississippi River</strong></em> were linked by <em><strong>a spiderweb of railroad tracks</strong></em>. Chicago’s growth illustrates the impact of these rail links. In 1849 Chicago was a village of a few hundred people with <em><strong>virtually</strong></em> no rail service. By 1860 it had become a city of 100,000, served by eleven railroads. Farmers to the north and west of Chicago no longer had to ship their <em><strong>grain, livestock, and dairy products</strong></em> down the Mississippi River to <em><strong>New Orleans</strong></em>; they could now ship their products directly east. <em><strong><u>Chicago supplanted New Orleans as the interior of America’s main commercial hub</u></strong></em>.</p><p>The east-west rail lines <em><u><strong>stimulated the settlement and agricultural development</strong></u></em> of the Midwest. By 1860 <em><strong>Illinois, Indiana, and Wisconsin</strong></em> had replaced <em><strong>Ohio, Pennsylvania, and New York</strong></em> as the leading wheat-growing states. Enabling farmers to speed their products to the East, railroads increased the value of farmland and promoted additional settlement. <em><strong><u>In turn</u></strong></em>, population growth in agricultural areas triggered industrial development in cities such as Chicago, Davenport (Iowa), and Minneapolis, for the new settlers needed <em><strong>lumber for fences and houses</strong></em> and <em><strong>mills to grind wheat into flour</strong></em>.</p><p>Railroads also <em><strong>propelled the growth of small towns along their routes</strong></em>. The Illinois Central Railroad, which had more track than any other railroad in 1855, made money not only from its traffic but also from <em><strong><u>real estate speculation</u></strong></em>. Purchasing land for stations along its path, the Illinois Central then <em><strong>laid out towns</strong></em> around the stations. The selection of Manteno ,Illinois, as a stop of the Illinois Central, for example, <em><strong><u>transformed the site from a crossroads without a single house in 1854 into a bustling town</u></strong></em> of nearly a thousand in 1860, <em><strong>replete with</strong></em> hotels, lumberyards, grain elevators, and gristmills. By the Civil War (1861–1865), few thought of the railroad-linked Midwest as <em><strong><u>a frontier region</u></strong></em> or viewed its inhabitants as <em><strong>pioneers</strong></em>.</p><p>As the nation’s first big business, the railroads <em><strong><u>transformed the conduct of business</u></strong></em>. During the early 1830s, railroads, like canals, depended on financial aid from state governments. <em><strong>With the onset of economic depression</strong></em> in the late 1830s, however, state governments <em><strong>scrapped overly ambitious railroad projects</strong></em>. Convinced that railroads burdened them with high taxes and blasted hopes, voters turned against state aid, and in the early 1840s, several states <em><strong><u>amended their constitutions to bar state funding for</u></strong></em> railroads and canals. The federal government <em><strong>took up some of the slack</strong></em>, but federal aid did not provide a major stimulus to railroads before 1860. Rather, part of the burden of finance passed to city and county governments in agricultural areas that wanted to attract railroads. Such <em><strong>municipal governments</strong></em>, for example, often gave railroads <em><strong>rights-of-way</strong></em>, grants of land for stations, and public funds.</p><p>The dramatic expansion of the railroad network in the 1850s, however, <em><u><strong>strained the financing capacity of local governments</strong></u></em> and required a turn toward private investment, <em><strong>which had never been absent from the picture</strong></em>. Well aware of the economic benefits of railroads, individuals living near them had long purchased railroad stock issued by governments and had directly bought stock in railroads, often paying by contributing their labor to building the railroads. But the large railroads of the 1850s needed more capital than such small investors could generate. Gradually, the center of railroad financing shifted to New York City, and in fact, it was the railroad boom of the 1850s that helped make Wall Street in New York City the nation’s greatest capital market. <em><strong><u>The stocks of all the leading railroads were traded on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange during the 1850s</u></strong></em>. In addition, the growth of railroads turned New York City into the center of modern investment firms. The investment firms evaluated the stock of railroads in the smaller American cities and then found purchasers for these stocks in New York City, Philadelphia, Paris, London, Amsterdam, and Hamburg. Controlling the flow of funds to railroads, the investment bankers began to <em><strong><u>exert influence over the railroads’ internal affairs</u></strong></em> by supervising administrative reorganizations <em><strong>in times of trouble</strong></em>.</p><hr><h2 id="P2-The-Achievement-of-Brazilian-Independence"><a href="#P2-The-Achievement-of-Brazilian-Independence" class="headerlink" title="P2 - The Achievement of Brazilian Independence"></a>P2 - The Achievement of Brazilian Independence</h2><h3 id="Overview-🧑🏻‍💻-1"><a href="#Overview-🧑🏻‍💻-1" class="headerlink" title="Overview 🧑🏻‍💻"></a>Overview 🧑🏻‍💻</h3><blockquote><p>Test Date：2023.7.31</p><p>Scores：8/10</p><p>Test Link：<a href="https://toefl.kmf.com/reading/exercise/61gvaj/169149416751197312/61gvaj/1">Link🔗</a></p></blockquote><h3 id="Passage-🍉-1"><a href="#Passage-🍉-1" class="headerlink" title="Passage 🍉"></a>Passage 🍉</h3><p>In contrast to the <em><strong><u>political anarchy, economic dislocation, and military destruction</u></strong></em> in Spanish America, <em><strong><u>Brazil’s drive toward independence from Portugal</u></strong></em> proceeded as a relatively bloodless transition between 1808 and 1822. The idea of Brazilian independence first arose in the late eighteenth century as a Brazilian reaction to the Portuguese policy of tightening political and economic control over the colony <strong><em>in the interests of the mother countr</em>y</strong>. The first significant <em><strong>conspiracy</strong></em> against Portuguese rule was organized from 1788–1799 in the province of Minas Gerais, where <em><strong><u>rigid governmental control over the production and prices of gold and diamonds</u></strong></em>, as well as heavy taxes, caused much discontent. But this conspiracy <em><strong>never went beyond the stage of discussion</strong></em> and was easily discovered and crushed. Other conspiracies in the late eighteenth century as well as a brief revolt in 1817 reflected the influence of <em><strong>republican ideas</strong></em> over sections of the elite and even the <em><strong>lower strata of urban society</strong></em>. <em><strong><u>All proved abortive or were soon crushed.</u></strong></em> <em><strong><u>Were it not for</u></strong></em> an accident of European history, the independence of Brazil might have been long delayed.</p><p><em><strong><u>The French invasion of Portugal</u></strong></em> in 1807 followed by <em><strong>the flight of the Portuguese court</strong></em> (<em><strong>sovereign</strong></em> and government officers) to <em><strong>Rio de Janeiro</strong></em> brought large benefits to Brazil. Indeed, the transfer of the court <em><strong>in effect</strong></em> signified achievement of Brazilian independence. The Portuguese prince and future King João VI opened Brazil’s ports to the trade of friendly nations, permitted the rise of local industries, and founded the Bank of Brazil. In 1815 he <em><strong><u>elevated Brazil to the legal status of a kingdom coequal with Portugal</u></strong></em>. <em><strong>In one sense</strong></em>, however, Brazil’s new status signified the substitution of one dependence for another. <em><strong>Freed from Portuguese control</strong></em>, Brazil came under the economic dominance of England, which obtained major <em><strong>tariff concessions</strong></em> and other privileges by the Strangford Treaty of 1810 between Portugal and Great Britain. <em><strong><u>The treaty provided for the importation of British manufactures into Brazil and the export of Brazilian agricultural produce to Great Britain</u></strong></em>. One result was an influx of cheap machine-made goods that swamped the handicrafts industry of the country.</p><p>Brazilian elites took satisfaction in Brazil‘s new role and the growth of educational, cultural, and economic opportunities for their class. But the feeling was mixed with <em><strong>resentment toward</strong></em> the thousands of <em><strong><u>Portuguese courtiers (officials) and hangers-on</u></strong></em> who came with the court and who competed with Brazilians for <em><strong><u>jobs and favors</u></strong></em>. Thus, the change in the status of Brazil <em><strong>sharpened the conflict</strong></em> between Portuguese elites born in Brazil and elites born in Portugal and loyal to the Portuguese crown.</p><p>The event that <em><strong>precipitated the break</strong></em> with the mother country was the revolution of 1820 in Portugal. <em><strong><u>The Portuguese revolutionaries framed a liberal constitution for the kingdom, but they were conservative or reactionary in relation to Brazil</u></strong></em>. They demanded the immediate return of King João to Lisbon, an end to the system of dual monarchy that he had devised, and the restoration of the Portuguese commercial monopoly. <em><strong>Timid and vacillating</strong></em>, King João did not know which way to turn. Under the pressure of his courtiers, who hungered to return to Portugal and their lost estates, he finally approved the new constitution and sailed for Portugal. He left behind him, however, his son and heir, Pedro, and in a private letter advised him that in the event the Brazilians should demand independence, he should <em><strong><u>assume leadership</u></strong></em> of the movement and set the crown of Brazil on his head.</p><p>Soon it became clear that the Portuguese parliament intended to set the clock back <em><strong><u>by abrogating all the liberties and concessions won by Brazil since 1808</u></strong></em>. One of its <em><strong>decrees</strong></em> insisted on the immediate return of Pedro from Brazil. The pace of events moved more rapidly in 1822. On January 9, urged on by Brazilian advisers who perceived <em><strong><u>a golden opportunity to make an orderly transition to independence without the intervention of the masses</u></strong></em>, Pedro refused an order from the parliament to return to Portugal, saying famously, “I remain”. On September 7, regarded by all Brazilians as Independence Day, <em><strong>he issued the even more celebrated proclamation</strong></em>, “Independence or death!” In December 1822, having overcome slight resistance by Portuguese troops, Dom Pedro was formally proclaimed constitutional Emperor of Brazil.</p><hr><h2 id="P3-Star-Death"><a href="#P3-Star-Death" class="headerlink" title="P3 - Star Death"></a>P3 - Star Death</h2><h3 id="Overview-🧑🏻‍💻-2"><a href="#Overview-🧑🏻‍💻-2" class="headerlink" title="Overview 🧑🏻‍💻"></a>Overview 🧑🏻‍💻</h3><blockquote><p>Test Date：2023.8.1</p><p>Scores：8/10</p><p>Test Link：<a href="https://toefl.kmf.com/reading/exercise/21gvpj/169155162175699671/21gvpj/1">Link🔗</a></p></blockquote><h3 id="Passage-🍉-2"><a href="#Passage-🍉-2" class="headerlink" title="Passage 🍉"></a>Passage 🍉</h3><p><em><strong><u>Until</u></strong></em> the early- to mid-twentieth century, scientists believed that stars generate energy by shrinking. As stars contracted, it was thought, they would get hotter and hotter, <em><strong>giving off light</strong></em> in the process. This could not be the primary way that stars shine, however. If it were, they would scarcely last a million years, rather than the billions of years in age that we know they are. We now know that <em><strong>stars are fueled by nuclear fusion</strong></em>. <em><strong><u>Each time fusion takes place, energy is released as a by-product</u></strong></em>. This energy, expelled into space, is what we see as starlight. The fusion process begins when two hydrogen nuclei smash together to form a particle called the deuteron (a combination of <em><strong>a positive proton</strong></em> and <em><strong>a neutral neutron</strong></em>). Deuterons <em><strong>readily</strong></em> combine with additional protons to form helium. Helium, in turn, can fuse together to form heavier elements, such as carbon. <strong><u><em>In a typical star, merger after merger takes place until significant quantities of heavy elements are built up</em></u></strong>.</p><p>We must distinguish, at this point, between two different stellar types: Population I and Population II, the latter being much older than the former. These groups can also be distinguished by their locations. <em><strong><u>Our galaxy, the Milky Way, is shaped like a flat disk surrounding a central bulge</u></strong></em>. Whereas Population I stars are found mainly in the galactic disk, Population II stars mostly reside in the central bulge of the galaxy and in the halo surrounding this bulge.</p><p><em><strong><u>Population II stars date to the early stages of the universe</u></strong></em>. Formed when the cosmos was filled with hydrogen and helium gases, they initially contained virtually no heavy elements. They shine until their <em><strong>fusible material</strong></em> is exhausted. When Population II stars die, their material is spread out into space. Some of this dust is eventually incorporated into newly formed Population I stars. Though Population I stars consist mostly of hydrogen and helium gas, they also contain heavy elements (heavier than helium), which <em><strong><u>comprise about 1 or 2 percent of their mass</u></strong></em>. These heavier materials are fused from the lighter elements that the stars have collected. Thus, Population I stars contain material that once belonged to stars from previous generations. The Sun is a good example of a Population I star.</p><p>What will happen when the Sun dies? In several billion years, our mother star will burn much brighter. It will <em><strong><u>expend more and more of its nuclear fuel</u></strong></em>, until little is left of its original hydrogen. Then, at some point in the far future, all nuclear reactions in the Sun’s center will cease.</p><p>Once the Sun passes into its “postnuclear” phase, it will separate effectively into two different regions: an inner zone and an outer zone. While no more hydrogen fuel will remain in the inner zone, there will be a small amount left in the outer zone. <em><strong><u>Rapidly, changes will begin to take place that will serve to tear the Sun apart</u></strong></em>. The inner zone, its nuclear fires no longer burning, will begin to collapse under the influence of its own weight and will contract into a tiny hot core, dense and dim. An opposite fate will await the outer region, a loosely held-together ball of gas. <em><strong>A shock wave</strong></em> caused by the inner zones contraction will <em><strong>send ripples through</strong></em> the dying star, pushing the stellar exterior’s material farther and farther outward. <em><strong>The outer envelope</strong></em> will then grow rapidly, increasing, <em><strong>in a short interval</strong></em>, hundreds of times in size. As it expands, it will cool down by thousands of degrees. Eventually, the Sun will become <em><strong>a red giant star</strong></em>, cool and bright. It will be so large that it will occupy the whole space that used to be the Earth’s orbit and so brilliant that it would be able to be seen with the naked eye <em><strong>thousands of light-years away</strong></em>. It will exist that way for millions of years, gradually releasing the material of its outer envelope into space. Finally, nothing will be left of the gaseous exterior of the Sun; all that will remain will be the hot, white core. The Sun will have become <em><strong>a white dwarf star</strong></em>. The core will shrink, giving off the last of its energy, and the Sun will finally die.</p><hr>]]></content>

So how’s your paper going?</p><p>&lt;-MALE STUDENT:-&gt; Pretty well. It’s a lot of work, but I’m getting into it, so I don’t mind. I’ll probably have some questions for you in the next week or so.</p><p>&lt;-FEMALE PROFESSOR:-&gt; OK, glad to hear you’re <strong>progressing</strong> so well.</p><p>&lt;-MALE STUDENT:-&gt; Um, there was something you said at the end of the lecture on Tuesday, something about there not really being any original plays…</p><p>&lt;-FEMALE PROFESSOR:-&gt; “There’s no such thing as an original play.” Yes, that’s the direct quote from Charles Mee.</p><p>&lt;-MALE STUDENT:-&gt; Mee. That’s with two E’s, right?</p><p>&lt;-FEMALE PROFESSOR:-&gt; Yep, M-E-E. You’ll probably be hearing a lot about him. He’s becoming a pretty famous <strong>playwright</strong>.</p><p>&lt;-MALE STUDENT:-&gt; Yeah, well, I’ve been thinking about his quote… I mean, there must be some original plays out there.</p><p>&lt;-FEMALE PROFESSOR:-&gt; I’ll grant that he’s overstating things <strong>somewhat</strong>. But the theater does have a long tradition of borrowing. Take Shakespeare; like most writers of his day, he borrowed plots from other sources <strong>unabashedly</strong>. And the ancient Greeks, all the plays they wrote were based on earlier plays, poems, and myths.</p><p>&lt;-MALE STUDENT:-&gt; And “borrowing” applies to plays being written nowadays, too?</p><p>&lt;-FEMALE PROFESSOR:-&gt; To some extent, yes. Mee, for example, he’s made a career out of remaking plays, one of which we’ll be studying soon.It’s called “Full Circle.” And Mee based it on an earlier play by a German playwright.</p><p>&lt;-MALE STUDENT:-&gt; Ohhh… “Full Circle.” Wasn’t that based on “The Caucasian Chalk Circle?”</p><p>&lt;-FEMALE PROFESSOR:-&gt; That’s right.</p><p>&lt;-MALE STUDENT:-&gt; I remember hearing about that play from my acting coach.</p><p>&lt;-FEMALE PROFESSOR:-&gt; Okay. Well, “The Caucasian Chalk Circle” was based on a play by yet another German playwright, someone who was fascinated by the ancient literatures of China, India, and Persia. And many of his works were adapted from those literatures, including his version of “The Chalk Circle,” which was based on an early Chinese play.</p><p>&lt;-MALE STUDENT:-&gt; So this “Full Circle” play by Charles Mee, the one we’re gonna study, it’s like the third or fourth remake.Wow! And we complain that Hollywood keeps making the same movies over and over again!</p><p>&lt;-FEMALE PROFESSOR:-&gt; Well, part of what Mee’s trying to do is drive home the point, that, one, theater’s always a collaborative effort…</p><p>&lt;-MALE STUDENT:-&gt; Well, yeah, the playwright, the director, the actors, people have to work together to produce a play.</p><p>&lt;-FEMALE PROFESSOR:-&gt; Yes, of course, but Mee means historically; the dramatic literature of early periods is hugely influential in shaping later dramatic works.</p><p>&lt;-MALE STUDENT:-&gt; So it’s like when a playwright bases a play on a previous playwright’s theme or message. It’s like they’re talking to each other, collaborating, uh, just not at the same time, right?</p><p>&lt;-FEMALE PROFESSOR:-&gt; Exactly. And the second point Mee’s trying to make, I think, is that it’s legitimate to retell an old story in a new way… in a way that’s, uh, <strong>more in line with contemporary concerns</strong>. So, when playwrights reinvent or update an earlier play, it shouldn’t be construed as a lack of imagination or an artistic failure.</p><hr><h2 id="Set2-🍉"><a href="#Set2-🍉" class="headerlink" title="Set2 🍉"></a>Set2 🍉</h2><blockquote><p>测试日期：2023.6.22</p><p>得分情况：5/6</p><p>真题主页：<a href="https://toefl.kmf.com/listen/ets/new-order/0">https://toefl.kmf.com/listen/ets/new-order/0</a></p><p>模拟练习：<a href="https://toefl.kmf.com/listening/pre?id=81mb9j">https://toefl.kmf.com/listening/pre?id=81mb9j</a></p><p>题目分析：<a href="http://top.zhan.com/toefl/listen/review-1352-13.html?article_id=1352">http://top.zhan.com/toefl/listen/review-1352-13.html?article_id=1352</a></p><p>精听链接：<a href="https://toefl.kmf.com/listening/newdrilling/81mb9j">https://toefl.kmf.com/listening/newdrilling/81mb9j</a></p></blockquote><p>&lt;-NARRATOR:-&gt;&nbsp;Listen to part of a lecture in a world history class.</p><p>&lt;-FEMALE PROFESSOR:-&gt; Now, <strong>according to Chinese legend</strong>, the first person to drink tea was a Chinese emperor who lived nearly 5,000 years ago.This emperor was… oh, you could call him an amateur scientist. And he wisely required all drinking water to be boiled, for <strong>hygiene</strong>.</p><p>So, once, uh, when visiting some distant part of his empire, he noticed that a breeze had blown some leaves into his pot of boiling water.And these leaves turned the water kind of brown.So… well, would it be your <strong>first impulse</strong> to drink this? Probably not.</p><p>But he thought <strong>the resulting brew</strong> smelled pretty good, and in the name of science and discovery, he tasted it, and the practice of drinking tea was born.Uh, well, a good story. But actually we cannot say with any certainty just who first discovered how to make tea.</p><p>We can be confident, though, that the Chinese have been using it in some form for close to 5,000 years. And, from those earliest times, more and more tea was cultivated to meet the growing demand, and tea became an important part of the economy of China.</p><p>In fact, it was formed into sort of bricks and used as a common type of currency for trade. But its effect on Chinese culture was even more profound.Tea became extremely popular in China, and scholars even wrote works discussing how to grow tea, prepare it, drink it… really <strong>championing</strong> tea… one of them saying it was like “<strong>the sweetest dew of heaven</strong>.” Now, recommendations like this could only add to its huge popularity there.</p><p>But tea was also spreading throughout Asia. In Japan, perhaps even more than in China, tea became a major cultural symbol—<strong>and one of refinement, of etiquette, and aesthetics</strong>. Uh, well, best seen in the traditional Japanese tea ceremony, which is still performed today. This is an intricate formal ritual, a ceremony that can take hours to complete.Clearly, tea became not just a beverage in Japanese culture—but much, much more.</p><p>Tea eventually got to western Europe after European traders, uh, mainly Portuguese and Dutch, brought the first small commercial shipment of tea back to Europe. Unfortunately, it was mostly just treated as a curiosity, since no one knew quite how it was supposed to be used. A few has some pretty strong opinions, though. One German doctor wrote a book saying tea was harmful, actually poisonous. But at about the same time, another doctor, uh, from Holland, wrote another book calling tea a miracle cure for just about everything.Who to believe? So, anyway, tea didn’t really catch on in Germany or France, as something just to enjoy drinking, they seemed to prefer coffee.</p><p>But England did take to tea, and to an extent that nobody could have foreseen… such that, even today we tend to associate England, uh, Great Britain with tea. And, uh, well, a bit of perspective, at the start of the eighteenth century, almost nobody in England drank tea; but by the end of it, almost everybody did. By the 1750s, official records show tea imports up from almost nothing to about 20 million kilos. And those records didn’t even begin to account for all the tea <strong>smuggled</strong> into the country illegally, to avoid paying taxes.</p><p>And as for reasons for the popularity of tea there … well, tea first became fashionable after the King of England married a Portuguese princess who loved tea, and pretty soon more and more people started copying her and drinking tea. Later, when a direct trade route was established between China and England, the supply of tea greatly increased.</p><p>Most important, though, tea drinking became sociable. And, uh, although <strong>coffee houses</strong> or <strong>taverns</strong> were generally considered to be for men only, tea shops became places where women could come and even bring their families. And soon there were tea parties, uh, books on <strong>tea etiquette</strong> and even tea gardens, parks filled with lights, and walkways, and, and <strong>venues</strong> for musical performances, places where people of all social classes could go to drink tea and socialize. By the end of the eighteenth century, all classes of English society drank tea, from royalty to common workers. <strong>Tea became a staple of everyday life</strong>, part of the common culture and, uh, traditionally considered by many… the very mark of being English.</p><hr><h2 id="Set4-🍒"><a href="#Set4-🍒" class="headerlink" title="Set4 🍒"></a>Set4 🍒</h2><blockquote><p>测试日期：2023.6.22</p><p>得分情况：4/5</p><p>真题主页：<a href="https://toefl.kmf.com/listen/ets/new-order/0">https://toefl.kmf.com/listen/ets/new-order/0</a></p><p>模拟练习：<a href="https://toefl.kmf.com/listening/pre?id=b1mbmj">https://toefl.kmf.com/listening/pre?id=b1mbmj</a></p><p>题目分析：<a href="http://top.zhan.com/toefl/listen/review-1352-13.html?article_id=1352">http://top.zhan.com/toefl/listen/review-1352-13.html?article_id=1352</a></p><p>精听链接：<a href="https://toefl.kmf.com/listening/newdrilling/b1mbmj">https://toefl.kmf.com/listening/newdrilling/b1mbmj</a></p></blockquote><p>&lt;-NARRATOR: -&gt; Listen to a conversation between a student and the cafeteria manager.</p><p>&lt;-MALE MANAGER:-&gt; Oh, hi, uh, you’re Amy, right?</p><p>&lt;-FEMALE STUDENT:-&gt; Yes.</p><p>&lt;-MALE MANAGER:-&gt; I haven’t seen you here for a while. Welcome back.</p><p>&lt;-FEMALE STUDENT:-&gt; Thanks, er, you’re right, I haven’t been eating here regularly like I used to.</p><p>&lt;-MALE MANAGER:-&gt; Why not?</p><p>&lt;-FEMALE STUDENT:-&gt; Couple of reasons. First of all, I have a class that ends during lunchtime. So, by the time I get here, there’s hardly any food left.</p><p>&lt;-MALE MANAGER:-&gt; Really?</p><p>&lt;-FEMALE STUDENT:-&gt; Yeah. And then, I have chemistry lab at night this semester. It’s two hours every Tuesday and Thursday. Y’know, that building’s way across campus. So I just eat something in my dorm before I leave, or skip dinner <strong>altogether</strong>. I come here afterward, but lab lets out at seven-thirty and…by then the cafeteria’s already closed.</p><p>&lt;-MALE MANAGER:-&gt; Oh, I’m really sorry. Well, what about getting something to go and eating it in class?</p><p>&lt;-FEMALE STUDENT:-&gt; I can’t. Food isn’t permitted anywhere near the laboratories. I wish you stayed open later.</p><p>&lt;-MALE MANAGER:-&gt; Have you complained formally? We’ve always had a suggestion box. And now, you can send us an e-mail.</p><p>&lt;-FEMALE STUDENT:-&gt; As a matter of fact, I did <strong>fill out a suggestion card</strong>. I asked for longer hours and for better food choices, too. But that was like weeks ago. And nothing’s changed from what I can see.</p><p>&lt;-MALE MANAGER:-&gt; You know, I was just <strong>promoted</strong> to cafeteria manager, and one of the things I’m trying to do is pay more attention to students’ concerns. There have been a lot of complaints similar to yours over the years.</p><p>&lt;-FEMALE STUDENT:-&gt; Yeah. A lot of my friends complain about the cafeteria, but we figure nothing will ever be done.</p><p>&lt;-MALE MANAGER:-&gt; Well, some things can change. For instance, you mentioned you’d like better food choices.Is there anything in particular you’d like added to our menu?</p><p>&lt;-FEMALE STUDENT:-&gt;Hmm, I guess it’d be nice to get hot cereal in the morning, and maybe a wider choice of soups and salads at lunch and dinner.

But, like many of the world’s waterways, the Chesapeake is being polluted; and efforts to stop that from happening have not been entirely successful.</p><p>And that’s partly because of the type of pollution affecting the Chesapeake… which may not be what you might predict. Uh, first let’s mention that the sources of pollution are of two general types. And let’s begin with what’s known as “point source pollution” .</p><p>Point source pollution has an identifiable source, and you can find the specific point where, say, <strong>one particular pipe is dumping pollutants into the bay</strong>—and then treat the water right there where the pollution’s coming from. And that’s what’s happened over the past 30 years or so. Modifications have been made at factories and <strong>sewage treatment plants</strong> to treat polluted water before it’s released into public waterways.But there’s also something we call “non-point source pollution.”</p><p>Nowadays, the most serious pollution threat doesn’t come from any particular source, like a factory or sewage treatment plant, but originates from many sources over a large area.And this non-point source pollution is a challenge to deal with, because it doesn’t just enter the bay through one pipe—you can’t identify precisely where it’s coming from.</p><p>And to be specific, the biggest problem now facing the Chesapeake Bay is due not to toxins, but to nutrients contained in chemical fertilizers used on farms all over the region.These nutrients—like <strong>phosphorus</strong> and especially nitrogen—wash away in what we call agricultural runoff. That’s when water from a hard rain or from melting snow carries these chemicals down to streams and into the bay, and there <strong>they stimulate the explosive growth of algae</strong>. And that uses up much of the oxygen in the water, oxygen that fish and other <strong>aquatic organisms</strong> need to stay alive.</p><p>So, since there’s no single place you can treat the runoff before it reaches the bay, any efforts to reduce this non-point source pollution generally need to be aimed at keeping pollution out of the streams in the first place.</p><p>But before we go into that, let’s look at the role of nitrogen fertilizer in modern farming. Until about 60 years ago, before a great increase in industrialization, this wasn’t a problem. In the past, farmers used natural fertilizers and <strong>rotated crops</strong> so that, in addition to commercial food crops, like corn and wheat, they might plant <strong>legumes</strong>, like alfalfa and clover, for animal feed. But these legumes also enriched the soil—<strong>by converting nitrogen in the atmosphere into nitrates</strong>—a form of nitrogen the crops like wheat or corn could use as a nutrient. And, these and other “cover crops,” planted to hold the soil after the wheat or corn was harvested—<strong>they stored much of the surplus nitrogen</strong> during the time of the year when the runoff tended to be greatest.</p><p>But farming practices changed as farmers came under pressure to use more and more chemical fertilizer in order to increase crop production on the same amount of land. But more isn’t always better, at least in terms of chemical fertilizer in the environment. And, along the way, farmers switched from legumes…to animal feeds more suited to intensive, large-scale animal production. And the excess nitrogen, once trapped by these cover crops, either washed away in the next big rain or went down into the groundwater and, either way, eventually ended up in the streams and the bay. And that, as we said, means more algae in the water and less oxygen for the fish and other aquatic life to breathe.</p><p>So what’s being done? Well, two things. First, after the main crops are harvested, more farmers are planting cover crops again—other kinds, like <strong>rye and barley</strong>—that hold the nitrogen and keep it from washing out of the soil during the months when that’s most likely to occur.</p><p>And the second strategy is to plant “buffer zones” at the edges of streams—not crops, but natural areas…trees. The roots of these trees can absorb the excess nitrogen in the runoff before it reaches the streams. Farmers sometimes <strong>object to</strong> letting trees grow on land where they might otherwise be cultivating crops. But there’s a government program that compensates them, that pays them for creating these buffer zones between their fields and the streams that eventually feed into bays like the Chesapeake. And it’s beginning to show some success.</p><hr><h2 id="Set6-🍇"><a href="#Set6-🍇" class="headerlink" title="Set6 🍇"></a>Set6 🍇</h2><blockquote><p>测试日期：2023.6.22</p><p>得分情况：5/6</p><p>真题主页：<a href="https://toefl.kmf.com/listen/ets/new-order/0">https://toefl.kmf.com/listen/ets/new-order/0</a></p><p>模拟练习：<a href="https://toefl.kmf.com/listening/pre?id=31mbzj">https://toefl.kmf.com/listening/pre?id=31mbzj</a></p><p>题目分析：<a href="http://top.zhan.com/toefl/listen/review-1353-13.html?article_id=1353">http://top.zhan.com/toefl/listen/review-1353-13.html?article_id=1353</a></p><p>精听链接：<a href="https://toefl.kmf.com/listening/newdrilling/31mbzj">https://toefl.kmf.com/listening/newdrilling/31mbzj</a></p></blockquote><p>&lt;-NARRATOR: -&gt;Listen to part of a lecture in an astronomy class.</p><p>&lt;-MALE PROFESSOR:-&gt; <strong>Saturn’s rings have always baffled astronomers</strong>. Until about 30 years ago, we thought <strong>the rings were composed of particles of ice and rock</strong> that were left over from Saturn’s formation—extra material that never managed to form, uh, <strong>coalesce into a moon</strong>. As you know, it’s believed that <strong>Saturn, and all the planets in our solar system coalesced from a swirling cloud of gas</strong> some 4.8 billion years ago. However, if the rings are made of leftovers from that process, then they’d also be about 4.8 billion years old. The problem is that anything gathering space dust for that long would certainly have darkened by now. But Saturn’s rings—most of them, anyway—are <strong>pristine</strong>…so bright and shiny that they make Saturn the jewel of the solar system.</p><p>So the hypothesis that the rings are just made of material left over from the time of planetary formation—that hypothesis must be wrong.Saturn’s rings are much younger than the planet itself. They may have formed only a few hundred million years ago—around the time the earliest dinosaurs lived on Earth. <strong>We realize now that the ring particles, which, uh, range in size from microscopic dust to boulders bigger than large houses</strong>. Well, a lot of these particles are eventually lost.We believe they gradually spiral down out of the rings and into the planet’s atmosphere.This occurs as a result of the planet’s gravity, and also because of the effects of its magnetic field …Now, if material from Saturn’s rings is being lost and nothing new is added from time to time, the rings would be disappearing.</p><p>But that’s not happening! So somehow, there must be new material feeding the ring system. Question is: Where’s this new material coming from? <strong>So we’re back to square one</strong>. But, instead of asking, “How did the rings form?” We should be asking… uh, anyone? Beth?</p><p>&lt;-FEMALE STUDENT:-&gt; How do the rings form?</p><p>&lt;-MALE PROFESSOR:-&gt; How do the rings form! Because they’re apparently replenishing themselves somehow.</p><p>Uh, OK, here’s one possibility—<strong>the moons, the dozens of moons that orbit Saturn are providing raw material for the rings</strong>. A moon <strong>in a system as complex as Saturn’s</strong>—and Saturn has at least 49 known moons, which vary tremendously in size and shape. Um, a moon in such a complex system is not only affected by the gravitational force of the planet, but also by that of the other moons.</p><p>&lt;-FEMALE STUDENT:-&gt; So the planet may be pulling a moon one way, and other moons may be pulling it…other ways?</p><p>&lt;-MALE PROFESSOR:-&gt; Exactly. <strong>Such forces could actually alter a moon’s orbit</strong>, and as a result, there might be a collision—one moon might crash into another—<strong>and the debris from that collision could become part of the rings</strong> .Then there are <strong>tidal forces</strong>. A moon might get too close to the planet and get broken apart by Saturn’s tidal forces.</p><p>&lt;-FEMALE STUDENT:-&gt; Excuse me. You mean, tidal forces, like high tide and low tide on the oceans?</p><p>&lt;-MALE PROFESSOR:-&gt; Well, by “tidal force,” I’m referring to the gravitational pull of Saturn on its moons. Um, in the mid-1800s, a French scientist named édouard Roche was studying the effects of a planet’s tidal forces on its moons.</p><p>Roche was able to show mathematically that if one <strong>celestial body</strong>—say, a moon—uh, if it passes too close to another—say, a planet—that has a gravitational force stronger than the force of self-attraction that holds the moon together, well, that first body, that moon, it’d be ripped apart. We call the distance at which this happens the “<strong>Roche limit</strong>.” So if one of Saturn’s moons reaches the Roche limit of the planet or even a larger moon, it would <strong>disintegrate</strong>—be torn apart, and thus add more material to the ring system.</p><p>And there’s another way new material might be added to Saturn’s rings—an asteroid crashing into one of the moons. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that some of the many rings are a bit <strong>reddish</strong> in color. Uh, yes, George?</p><p>&lt;-MALE STUDENT:-&gt; I’m sorry. I don’t follow the logic.</p><p>&lt;-MALE PROFESSOR:-&gt; Well, <strong>this reddish coloration suggests the presence of complex organic molecules</strong>—uh, carbon-based molecules—mixed in with the water-ice. Remember, the rest of Saturn’s rings are made almost entirely of water-ice. And none of Saturn’s moons is red. But asteroids could be… and thus could end up contributing to the ring system the kind of carbon-based molecules we’re talking about.</p>]]></content>

Your submitted <code>.zip</code> file should contain two files named <code>pytorch101.ipynb</code> and <code>knn.ipynb</code>.</p><p>We have written a <a href="https://github.com/deepvision-class/tools#homework-validation">validation script</a> for you to check the structure of your submitted <code>.zip</code> file. This script does not check whether your homework is correct; it only makes sure that your submitted file has the right structure, that you didn’t modify any parts of the <code>.ipynb</code> files that you shouldn’t have, and that you didn’t miss any sections where you were supposed to write code. <strong>In order to be graded, your assignment must pass this validation script</strong>.

<strong>从规则库中选择与综合数据库的己知事实进行匹配</strong>。所谓匹配是指把规则的前提条件与综合数据库中的已知事实进行比较，如果两者一致，或者近似一致且满足预先规定的条件，则称匹配成功，相应的规则可被使用，否则称为匹配不成功。</li><li><strong>冲突消解</strong>。匹配成功的规则可能不止一条,这称为发生了冲突。此时，推理机构必须调用相应的解决冲突策略进行消解，以便从匹配成功的规则中选出一条执行。</li><li><strong>执行规则</strong>。如果某一规则的右部是一个或多个结论，则把这些结论加人到综合数据库中；如果规则的右部是一个或多个操作，则执行这些操作。对于不确定性知识，在执行每一条规则时还要按一定的算法计算结论的不确定性。</li><li><strong>检查推理终止条件</strong>。检查综合数据库中是否包含了最终结论，决定是否停止系统的运行。</li></ul></li></ul><h4 id="产生式表示法的特点"><a href="#产生式表示法的特点" class="headerlink" title="产生式表示法的特点"></a>产生式表示法的特点</h4><p><strong>产生式表示法的主要优点</strong></p><ul><li><strong>自然性</strong><ul><li>产生式表示法用「如果⋯⋯，则⋯」的形式表示知识，这是人们常用的一种表达因果关系的知识表示形式,既直观、自然，又便于进行推理。正是由于这一原因，才使得产生式表示法成为人工智能中最重要且应用最多的一种知识表示方法。</li></ul></li><li><strong>模块性</strong><ul><li>产生式是规则库中最基本的知识单元，它们同推理机构相对独立，而且每条规则都具有相同的形式。这就便于对其进行模块化处理，为知识的增、删、改带来了方便，为规则库的建立和扩展提供了可管理性。</li></ul></li><li><strong>有效性</strong><ul><li>产生式表示法既可表示确定性知识，又可表示不确定性知识;既有利于表示启发式知识，又可方便地表示过程性知识。目前已建造成功的专家系统大部分是用产生式来表达其过程性知识的。</li></ul></li><li><strong>清晰性</strong><ul><li>产生式有固定的格式。每一条产生式规则都由前提与结论（操作）这两部分组成，而且每一部分所含的知识量都比较少。这既便于对规则进行设计，又易于对规则库中知识的一致性及完整性进行检测。</li></ul></li></ul><p><strong>产生式表示法的主要缺点</strong></p><ul><li><strong>效率不高</strong><ul><li>在产生式系统求解问题的过程中，首先要用 <strong>产生式的前提部分与综合数据库中的已知事实进行匹配</strong>，从规则库中选出可用的规则，此时 <strong>选出的规则可能不止一个</strong>，这就需要按一定的策略进行「<strong>冲突消解</strong>」，然后把选中的规则启动执行。因此，产生式系统求解问题的过程是一个反复进行「<strong>匹配一冲突消解一执行</strong>」的过程。鉴于 <strong>规则库一般都比较庞大</strong>，而 <strong>匹配又是一件十分费时</strong> 的工作，因此其工作效率不高，而且大量的产生式规则容易引起组合爆炸。</li></ul></li><li><strong>不能表达具有结构性的知识</strong><ul><li>产生式 <strong>适合于表达具有因果关系的过程性知识</strong>，是一种非结构化的知识表示方法，所以对具有结构关系的知识却无能为力，它不能把具有结构关系的事物间的区别与联系表示出来。</li></ul></li></ul><hr><h3 id="四、框架表示法"><a href="#四、框架表示法" class="headerlink" title="四、框架表示法"></a>四、框架表示法</h3><h4 id="框架表示法的概念"><a href="#框架表示法的概念" class="headerlink" title="框架表示法的概念"></a>框架表示法的概念</h4><p><strong>框架</strong> 是一种描述所讨论对象（一个事物、事件或概念）属性的 <strong>数据结构</strong>。</p><p>一个 <strong>框架</strong> 由若干个被称为「<strong>槽</strong>（Slot）」的结构组成，每一个槽又可根据实际情况划分为若干个「侧面(facet）」。</p><ul><li><p>一个槽用于描述所讨论对象某一方面的属性。</p></li><li><p>一个侧面用于描述相应属性的一个方面。</p></li><li><p>槽和侧面所具有的属性值分别被称为槽值和侧面值。</p></li></ul><h4 id="框架表示法的特点"><a href="#框架表示法的特点" class="headerlink" title="框架表示法的特点"></a>框架表示法的特点</h4><ul><li><strong>结构性</strong><ul><li>框架表示法最突出的特点是<strong>便于表达结构性知识</strong>，能够将知识的内部结构关系及知识间的联系表示出来，因此它是一种结构化的知识表达方法。</li><li>产生式规则只能表示因果关系，而 <strong>框架表示法</strong> 不仅可以通过 Infer 槽或者 Possible-reason 槽<strong>表示因果关系</strong>，还可以通过其他槽 <strong>表示更复杂的关系</strong>。</li></ul></li><li><strong>继承性</strong><ul><li>框架表示法通过使槽值为另一个框架的名字实现框架间的联系，建立表示复杂知识的框架网络。在框架网络中，下层框架可以继承上层框架的槽值，也可以进行补充和修改,这样不仅减少了知识的冗余，而且较好地保证了知识的一致性。</li></ul></li><li><strong>自然性</strong><ul><li>框架表示法与人在观察事物时的思维活动是一致的，比较自然。</li></ul></li></ul><hr><h3

<strong>三个参与者</strong>：一个人类评判者（通常是通过电脑终端与参与者进行对话）、一个人类参与者和一个机器参与者。评判者与这两个参与者进行文字对话，但无法直接看到他们的身份。如果评判者无法准确地判断哪个参与者是人类，哪个是机器，那么机器被认为通过了图灵测试，表现出了人类级别的智能。</p><p>图灵测试的目标是测试机器是否能够模仿人类的对话行为，包括语言理解、推理、逻辑和判断等能力。机器需要能够以自然而流畅的方式与评判者进行交流，并对问题作出合理的回答，使评判者无法准确判断其是否是机器。</p><p>尽管图灵测试是评估机器智能的一种方法，但它并不是完美的。批评者指出，通过图灵测试只能判断机器是否能够模仿人类的对话，但并不能真正评估其智能的本质。此外，有些人工智能系统可能通过欺骗或采用特定的策略来模仿人类回答，而并非真正具备智能。</p><p>尽管如此，图灵测试仍然是人工智能领域中广泛使用的一种标准和基准。它促使了对自然语言处理、对话系统和智能代理的研究和发展，推动了人工智能技术的进步。</p><hr><h3

题解分析</h2><p>本题对于 <strong>算法初学者</strong> 来说有点难度，且网络上的题解都不是特别清晰，故摊主撰写了本篇详细的题解分析，希望能在未来帮助到更多的同学。</p><br><p>首先以 $N=1$，即 <strong>一位数</strong> 为例，统计一位数中 包含偶数个 3 的个数，记作 $f[1]_偶$ ；统计包含奇数个 3 的个数，记作 $f[1]_奇$ </p><ul><li>由于 0 也是偶数，所以 「<strong>0 个 3</strong>」 也满足偶数个 3 的条件，故 $f[1]_偶$ 为 1～2，4～9，共 8 个数（注意：0 不是一位数），$f[1]_偶 = 8$</li><li>奇数个3 的情况只有单独的 3，所以 $f[1]_奇 = 1$</li></ul><blockquote><p>🍉 PS：有的小伙伴可能会问，题目不是求偶数的情况就够了吗？为什么要还要统计奇数的情况？继续往下看，你就明白了）</p></blockquote><br><p>然后以 $N=2$，即 <strong>两位数</strong> 为例，统计两位数中 包含偶数个 3 的个数，记作 $f[2]_偶$ ；统计包含奇数个 3 的个数，记作 $f[2]_奇$ </p><p>对于 $f[2]_偶$，可以分两种情况进行统计：</p><ul><li><strong>十位为 3</strong>，则 个位必须为奇数个 3，数量为 $f[1]_奇$</li><li><strong>十位不为 3</strong>（十位可以为 1～2，4～9，<strong>共 8 个数</strong>），则 个位必须为偶数个 3 ，数量为 $f[1]_偶$</li></ul><p>所以 $f[2]_偶 = f[1]_奇 + 8 * f[1]_偶$ </p><p>然后我们带入 $f[1]_奇$、$f[1]_偶$ ，得 $f[2]_偶 = f[1]_奇 + 8 * f[1]_偶=1+8*8=65$ ，却发现与样例答案 73 不相等。❌</p><br><p>这是什么原因造成的呢 ?  🧐 　</p><p>实际上，当我们单独拿$f[1]_奇$、$f[1]_偶$ 讨论时，由于 <strong>0 不为一位数</strong>，所以 $f[1]_偶$ 为 1～2，4～9，共 8 个。</p><p>但是当 $N=2$ 时，由于十位上有了数字，所以此时个位上的数字是可以为 0 的，因此在计算 $f[2]_偶$ 时，$f[1]_偶$ 可以取到 0～2，4～9，共 9 个。（<strong>本质</strong>是 <strong>一位数</strong> 和 <strong>个位上的数字</strong> 的区别）</p><p>同理，$f[1]_奇$ 也要考虑 0 的情况，但是此时 0 并不满足 「奇数个3的条件」，所以 $f[1]_奇$ 仍然为 1（这里 $f[1]_奇$ 的值虽然没有变，但是后面的 $f[2]_奇、f[3]_奇$、…、$f[n]_奇$ 的值会在更新后发生改变）</p><p>把新的 $f[1]_偶$、$f[1]_奇$ 的值带入，得到  $f[2]_偶 = f[1]_奇 + 8 * f[1]_偶=1+8*9=73$ </p><p>即为样例答案 73。</p><p>同理，$f[2]_奇 = f[1]_偶 + 8 * f[1]_奇=9+8*1=17$</p><blockquote><p>上面这个 $f[1]_偶$、$f[1]_奇$ 为什么要更新的的原因，是本题的难点，也是本题的解题关键。现在不理解也没关系，继续往下阅读，再分析一个案例，也许你就理解了。</p></blockquote><br><p>然后以 $N=3$，即 <strong>三位数</strong> 为例，也是类似的过程。</p><p>对于 $f[3]_偶$，可以分两种情况：</p><ul><li><strong>百位为 3</strong>，则 十位和个位总体 必须为 奇数个 3，数量为 $f[2]_奇$</li><li><strong>百位不为 3</strong>，则 十位和个位总体 必须为 偶数个 3，数量为 $f[2]_偶$</li></ul><p>所以 $f[3]_偶 = f[2]_奇 + 8 * f[2]_偶$</p><p>同理，$f[3]_奇 = f[2]_偶 + 8 * f[2]_奇$</p><p>同样，由于在计算 $f[2]_奇$ 、$f[2]_偶$ 时，十位不能为0；而引入百位后，十位可以为 0，所以如果要输出的是三位数的结果，则在计算 $f[2]_奇$ 、$f[2]_偶$ 时，也需要考虑 0</p><br><p>现在我们 <strong>重新计算</strong> 求解 $f[3]_偶$ 、$f[3]_奇$ 情况下的 $f[2]_偶$ 、$f[2]_奇$ </p><p>我们在上一步中计算的 $f[2]_偶 = f[1]_奇 + 8 * f[1]_偶=1+8*9=73$ </p><p>其中 8 这个系数，是十位不为 3 ，取 1～2，4～9 得到的（当时十位不能为 0）。但是现在，由于十位可以为0 ，所以十位可以取 0～2，4～9 共 9 个数字，所以上面式子中的系数应该为 9，而不是 8。</p><p>所以新的 $f[2]_偶 = f[1]_奇 + 9 * f[1]_偶=1+9*9=82$ </p><p>同理，新的 $f[2]_奇 = f[1]_偶 + 9 * f[1]_奇=9+9*1=18$</p><p>在得到了新的 $f[2]_偶$、$f[2]_奇$ 后，再带入 $f[3]_偶 = f[2]_奇 + 8 * f[2]_偶$，就能得到正确的 $f[3]_偶$</p><p>🍉 PS：$f[3]_偶 = f[2]_奇 + 8 * f[2]_偶$，这里的系数 8 并不会变成 9，因为此时百位是最高位，不能为 0。</p><p>但是同理，当 $N=4$ 时，由于有千位的存在，百位就可以为 0 ，那么计算$f[3]_偶$ 时，其数值就应该更新为 $f[3]_偶 = f[2]_奇 + 9 * f[2]_偶$</p><blockquote><p>上面推导过程中， $f[2]_偶$、$f[2]_奇$ 为什么要更新，并且 「公式系数从 8 改为 9」的原因，以及计算 $f[3]_偶$、$f[3]_奇$ 时，「公式系数仍为 8 」的原因，是本题的难点，也是本题的解题关键。⭐️</p></blockquote><br><p>根据上面的推导，我们可以得到最终 <strong>n 位数的结果</strong>：</p><ul><li><p>$f[n]_偶 = f[n-1]_奇 + 8 * f[n-1]_偶$</p></li><li><p>$f[n]_奇 = f[n-1]_偶 + 8 * f[n-1]_奇$</p></li></ul><p>而在计算 $f[n-1]_奇$、$f[n-1]_偶$ 时，由于此时最高位可以为 0，上面递推式中表示 1～2，4～9的系数「8」就变成了0～2，4～9的系数「9」，递推公式为：</p><ul><li><p>$f[n-1]_偶 = f[n-2]_奇 + 9 * f[n-2]_偶$</p></li><li><p>$f[n-1]_奇 = f[n-2]_偶 + 9 * f[n-2]_奇$</p></li></ul><p>所以在书写代码时，也需要分为两个表达式来写。✅</p><p>🍉 PS1：在实际编程中，我们可以用 $f[N][0]$ 来表示 $f[N]_偶$ ，用 $f[N][1]$ 来表示 $f[N]_奇$</p><p>🍉 PS2：这种递推问题的答案可能很大，甚至超出 <code>long long</code> 的范围，所以不要忘记题干中的取模要求。</p><hr><h2 id="🧑🏻‍💻-C-代码"><a href="#🧑🏻‍💻-C-代码" class="headerlink" title="🧑🏻‍💻 C++ 代码"></a>🧑🏻‍💻 C++ 代码</h2><pre class="line-numbers

id="😑-吐槽时间"><a href="#😑-吐槽时间" class="headerlink" title="😑 吐槽时间"></a>😑 吐槽时间</h3><p>摊主本人在阅读其他一些题解时，发现有的题解在分析时，认为 $f[1][0]=8$（ 1～2，4～9，因为 0 不算一位数），但是实际代码中，却出现 $f[1][0] = 9$ 的情况，并且没有交代原因。这样的前后矛盾，让不少看题解的小伙伴们感到困惑。</p><p>摊主还发现，有的题解就直接认为 $f[1][0]$ 就应该等于 9，把 0 也算成了一位数，这从 <strong>数学定义的角度</strong> 来看是错误的。❌ （有疑惑的小伙伴可以查阅以下问题：0 算不算一位数 ? 一位数和个位数有什么区别？）</p><p>从推导过程中，我们看到只有在 $N &gt; 1$ 时，<code>f[1][0]</code> 才因为进制的规则，变成了 9。</p><p>说明写其他题解的作者可能没有仔细考虑这其中的关系，这也是摊主撰写此篇题解的原因，希望本题解能真正解答一些小伙伴们的困难。</p><p>摊主也希望阅读此篇题解后，理解了本题的小伙伴，在未来自己写其他题目的题解时，多一份耐心与细致，不要让更多灌水、没有太多思考的题解，污染了这片土壤，浪费其他小伙伴搜索与阅读的时间。☘️</p>]]></content>

PS：使用 <code>scanf</code> 读入时，需要考虑 <strong>换行符的读入</strong>，而 <code>cin</code> 则不用，这是 <code>scanf</code> 的缺点；但 <code>scanf</code> 的读入速度比没有开 cin 读入优化的 <code>cin</code> 快很多，这是 <code>scanf</code> 的优点。</p><p><code>cin</code> 在开了 <code>cin</code> 读入优化后，速度基本上能达到 <code>scanf</code> 的水平，此题完全够用了。</p><br><p><strong>对于第二个难点</strong>，摊主采用了 <strong>遍历模拟</strong> 的方法，每天都遍历一次二维矩阵，模拟感染过程。</p><p>模拟过程也非常简单，只需在遍历时，遇到 ‘@’ 的房间，就把四周非空的房间置为 ‘@’</p><p>❗️❗️❗️但是这种方式非常容易出现 <strong>一个误区</strong>，就是 「<strong>每次矩阵还没有遍历完</strong>，就急着把 <strong>当前房间感染的新房间置为 ‘@’</strong>

✍️</h2><blockquote><p><strong>本周个人排名</strong>：894/2025</p><p><strong>AC情况</strong>：1/3</p><p>周赛当天晚上，博主在影院观看《流浪地球2》，未实时参加，是在之后的时间里定时自测的。🎬</p><p>感觉自测的氛围和实时比赛还是很不一样的，没有比赛时那种紧张感。人比较松弛，解题时相对从容淡定，希望真正比赛时，也能保持这样的心态，而不是无谓的焦急和紧张。😊</p><p>这也是博主参加的第三次周赛，经过前两次的历练，感觉自己的水平已经有一点提升了。虽然从纸面数据来看，这次只 AC 了 1 题，但是自己做题时的思路却相比前两次开阔了不少，代码完成度也比较高。</p><p>T2 博主是用邻接表存储图，然后对于每个点 DFS 搜索，最后通过邻接矩阵判断所有点是否互通（现场提交时一直 <code>Segmentation Fault</code>，没能顺利找出 BUG。<strong>复盘时</strong>，顺利找出相关BUG（还挺多的。。。），最终根据该思路写出相应 AC 代码；当然，经过y总讲解，发现本题也是一道 <strong>思维题</strong>，直接判断最外层是否为 顺时针/逆时针 即可。</p><p>T3 博主第一反应是用DP，根据思路写出了大部分代码，但是提交结果是 11/15，仍有 4 个测试点没有通过。<strong>复盘时</strong>，经过y总讲解，去学习了 <strong>状态机DP</strong> 的相关内容，顺利写出AC代码。</p><p>总之来说，周赛给自己的提升还是很大的，继续加油 😀</p></blockquote><p><img src="https://ricky-typora-notes.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/2023-02-21-170415.png" alt="周赛rank图"></p><h2 id="周赛信息-📚"><a

🎉</p><p>大年三十都有1k多名小伙伴一起打比赛，不得不说 Acwing 的学习氛围真好</p><p>这是博主第二次参加的周赛，从排名比来看，相比第一次的 28.7% 略有进步😀</p><p>但是不知道为什么这次敲代码时比上次急躁不少，也许是第一次周赛复盘时，看见 TOP5 的大佬都是不到 5 分钟敲完了，实力的差距让自己有了心理压力吧</p><p>但是怎么说呢，实力和题量放在那，其实自己再怎么着急也是无济于事的，焦急的心态反而会影响自己的发挥，不如稳下心来，慢慢思考。</p><p>希望下次能够摆正心态，同时平常更加努力学习，继续加油 💪</p></blockquote><p><img

n 个结点</p><p>Step2：求出以 <strong>结点 i 为根</strong> 的 <strong>子树高度最大值</strong> 和 <strong>次大值</strong>，两者之和就是以当前结点 i 为根的直径</p><p>Step3：输出 n 个结点的直径最大值</p><p>根据该解题思路，编写相应代码，具体见 y总讲解视频：<a href="https://www.acwing.com/video/4611/">视频链接</a></p><p><strong>【二刷经历】</strong></p><p>2023 年 4 月 11 日，摊主想要把这篇文章上传至自己的博客网站，于是再次阅读了这篇复盘，打算检查文章可能存在的错误。</p><p>在检查的过程中，摊主突然发现 C 题又不会做了，说明当时还是没有理解透彻，需要回炉重造。😂</p><p>回顾一下自己晚上的做题流程：</p><ul><li><p>发现该题描述的数据结构为「树」</p></li><li><p>书写「邻接表」代码，存储树的结点和边</p></li><li><p>发现解题策略</p><ul><li>选择一个结点 <code>u</code> 作为根结点</li><li>计算 <code>u</code> 的所有子树深度</li><li>取最大深度和次大深度为最终答案</li></ul></li><li><p>根据思路书写代码框架</p></li><li><p>但是在写 <code>dfs</code> 时，发现理不清输入值、返回值、终止条件以及是否往回搜的判断条件</p></li></ul><p>于是又去回顾了y总的讲解视频，以及自己写的代码注释，发现上面的思路其实存在一定问题。</p><p>上面的思路其实默认了「一开始选择哪个点作为根结点，得到的子树最大深度和次大深度之和都是一样的」，这是不对的 ❌ </p><p>比如根结点 <code>u</code> 有 3 棵子树 <code>ch1</code>，<code>ch2</code>，<code>ch3</code></p><ul><li>子树 <code>ch1</code> 的深度为 2</li><li>子树 <code>ch3</code> 的深度为 1</li><li>子树 <code>ch2</code> 的根结点为 <code>v</code>，<code>v</code> 上又有两棵子树<ul><li>一棵深度为 7 </li><li>另一棵深度为 8</li></ul></li></ul><p>按照上面的思路，最后答案是 子树 <code>ch2</code> 的最大深度 8 + <code>ch1</code> 的深度 2 等于 10。</p><p>但是显然，正确答案应该是 <code>v</code> 的两棵子树的深度之和，应该为 15 才对。</p><p>由此可见，从 <code>u</code> 往下遍历的过程中，<code>ans</code> 应该不断进行比较，即 <code>ans = max(d1+d2,ans)</code>，才能保证最后的答案是正确的。✅</p><p>同时还需思考，如何书写代码，才能使搜索从 <code>u</code> 一直往下，而 <strong>不会出现往回搜</strong> 的情况。</p><p>本题 <strong>值得反复咀嚼</strong> 的一些点：</p><ul><li>dfs 的含义究竟是什么？</li><li>dfs 的输入值为什么是 <code>int dfs(int u, int fa)</code>，<code>fa</code> 有什么作用？</li><li>添加 <code>st[]</code> 数组可以达到 <code>fa</code> 的作用吗？</li><li>dfs 的返回值是什么?</li><li>dfs 是如何实现深度累加的？</li><li>为什么是 <code>ans = max(ans,d1 + d2)</code> 而不是直接 <code>ans = d1 + d2</code> ？</li></ul><h4 id="【复盘后的优化代码】✅-2"><a href="#【复盘后的优化代码】✅-2"

This dataset contains the top 100 streamed songs on Spotify in 2018. In a terminal window, run <code>sqlite3 songs.db</code> so that you can begin executing queries on the database.</p><p>First, when <code>sqlite3</code> prompts you to provide a query, type <code>.schema</code> and press enter. This will output the <code>CREATE TABLE</code> statements that were used to generate each of the tables in the database. By examining those statements, you can identify the columns present in each table.</p><p>Notice that every <code>artist</code> has an <code>id</code> and a <code>name</code>. Notice, too, that every song has a <code>name</code>, an <code>artist_id</code> (corresponding to the <code>id</code> of the artist of the song), as well as values for the danceability, energy, key, loudness, speechiness (presence of spoken words in a track), valence, tempo, and duration of the song (measured in milliseconds).</p><p>The challenge ahead of you is to write SQL queries to answer a variety of different questions by selecting data from one or more of these tables. After you do so, you’ll reflect on the ways Spotify might use this same data in their annual <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spotify_Wrapped">Spotify Wrapped</a> campaign to characterize listeners’ habits.</p><h2 id="Implementation-Details-📚"><a href="#Implementation-Details-📚" class="headerlink" title="Implementation Details 📚"></a>Implementation Details 📚</h2><p>For each of the following problems, you should write a single SQL query that outputs the results specified by each problem. Your response must take the form of a single SQL query, though you may nest other queries inside of your query.

In each round, each team plays another team and the losing teams are eliminated. When only two teams remain, the winner of the final match is the champion.</p><p>In soccer, teams are given <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Rankings#Current_calculation_method">FIFA Ratings</a>, which are numerical values representing each team’s relative skill level. Higher FIFA ratings indicate better previous game results, and given two teams’ FIFA ratings, it’s possible to estimate the probability that either team wins a game based on their current ratings. The FIFA Ratings from two previous World Cups are available as the <a href="https://www.fifa.com/fifa-world-ranking/ranking-table/men/rank/id12189/">May 2018 Men’s FIFA Ratings</a> and <a href="https://www.fifa.com/fifa-world-ranking/ranking-table/women/rank/ranking_20190329/">March 2019 Women’s FIFA Ratings</a>.</p><p>Using this information, we can simulate the entire tournament by repeatedly simulating rounds until we’re left with just one team. And if we want to estimate how likely it is that any given team wins the tournament, we might simulate the tournament many times (e.g. 1000 simulations) and count how many times each team wins a simulated tournament. 1000 simulations might seem like many, but with today’s computing power we can accomplish those simulations in a matter of milliseconds. At the end of this lab, we’ll experiment with how worthwhile it might be to increase the number of simulations we run, given the trade-off of runtime.</p><p>Your task in this lab is to do just that using Python!</p><h2 id="Getting-Started-🍉"><a href="#Getting-Started-🍉" class="headerlink" title="Getting Started 🍉"></a>Getting Started 🍉</h2><p>Open <a href="https://code.cs50.io/">VS Code</a>.</p><p>Start by clicking inside your terminal window, then execute <code>cd</code> by itself.

This file contains the 16 teams in the knockout round of the 2018 Men’s World Cup and the ratings for each team. Notice that the CSV file has two columns, one called <code>team</code> (representing the team’s country name) and one called <code>rating</code> (representing the team’s rating).</p><p>The order in which the teams are listed determines which teams will play each other in each round (in the first round, for example, Uruguay will play Portugal and France will play Argentina; in the next round, the winner of the Uruguay-Portugal match will play the winner of the France-Argentina match). So be sure not to edit the order in which teams appear in this file!</p><p>Ultimately, in Python, we can represent each team as a dictionary that contains two values: the team name and the rating. Uruguay, for example, we would want to represent in Python as <code>{"team": "Uruguay", "rating": 976}</code>.</p><p>Next, take a look at <code>2019w.csv</code>, which contains data formatted the same way for the 2019 Women’s World Cup.</p><p>Now, open <code>tournament.py</code> and see that we’ve already written some code for you. The variable <code>N</code> at the top represents how many World Cup simulations to run: in this case, 1000.</p><p>The <code>simulate_game</code> function accepts two teams as inputs (recall that each team is a dictionary containing the team name and the team’s rating), and simulates a game between them. If the first team wins, the function returns <code>True</code>; otherwise, the function returns <code>False</code>.</p><p>The <code>simulate_round</code> function accepts a list of teams (in a variable called <code>teams</code>) as input, and simulates games between each pair of teams. The function then returns a list of all of the teams that won the round.</p><p>In the <code>main</code> function, notice that we first ensure that <code>len(sys.argv)</code> (the number of command-line arguments) is 2. We’ll use command-line arguments to tell Python which team CSV file to use to run the tournament simulation. We’ve then defined a list called <code>teams</code> (which will eventually be a list of teams) and a dictionary called <code>counts</code> (which will associate team names with the number of times that team won a simulated tournament). Right now they’re both empty, so populating them is left up to you!</p><p>Finally, at the end of <code>main</code>, we sort the teams in descending order of how many times they won simulations (according to <code>counts</code>) and print the estimated probability that each team wins the World Cup.</p><p>Populating <code>teams</code> and <code>counts</code> and writing the <code>simulate_tournament</code> function are left up to you!</p><h2 id="Implementation-Details-📚"><a href="#Implementation-Details-📚" class="headerlink" title="Implementation Details 📚"></a>Implementation Details 📚</h2><p>Complete the implementation of <code>tournament.py</code>, such that it simulates a number of tournaments and outputs each team’s probability of winning.</p><p>First, in <code>main</code>, read the team data from the CSV file into your program’s memory, and add each team to the list <code>teams</code>.</p><ul><li>The file to use will be provided as a command-line argument. You can access the name of the file, then, with <code>sys.argv[1]</code>.</li><li>Recall that you can open a file with <code>open(filename)</code>, where <code>filename</code> is a variable storing the name of the file.</li><li>Once you have a file <code>f</code>, you can use <code>csv.DictReader(f)</code> to give you a “reader”: an object in Python that you can loop over to read the file one row at a time, treating each row as a dictionary.</li><li>By default, all values read from the file will be strings. So be sure to first convert the team’s <code>rating</code> to an <code>int</code> (you can use the <code>int</code> function in Python to do this).</li><li>Ultimately, append each team’s dictionary to <code>teams</code>. The function call <code>teams.append(x)</code> will append <code>x</code> to the list <code>teams</code>.</li><li>Recall that each team should be a dictionary with a <code>team</code> name and a <code>rating</code>.</li></ul><p>Next, implement the <code>simulate_tournament</code> function. This function should accept as input a list of teams and should repeatedly simulate rounds until you’re left with one team. The function should the return the name of that team.</p><ul><li>You can call the <code>simulate_round</code> function, which simulates a single round, accepting a list of teams as input and returning a list of all of the winners.</li><li>Recall that if <code>x</code> is a list, you can use <code>len(x)</code> to determine the length of the list.</li><li>You should not assume the number of teams in the tournament, but you may assume it will be a power of 2.</li></ul><p>Finally, back in the <code>main</code> function, run <code>N</code> tournament simulations, and keep track of how many times each team wins in the <code>counts</code> dictionary.</p><ul><li>For example, if Uruguay won 2 tournaments and Portugal won 3 tournaments, then your <code>counts</code> dictionary should be <code>{"Uruguay": 2, "Portugal": 3}</code>.</li><li>You should use your <code>simulate_tournament</code> to simulate each tournament and determine the winner.</li><li>Recall that if <code>counts</code> is a dictionary, then syntax like <code>counts[team_name] = x</code> will associate the key stored in <code>team_name</code> with the value stored in <code>x</code>.</li><li>You can use the <code>in</code> keyword in Python to check if a dictionary has a particular key already.

Indeed, when describing the running time of an algorithm, we typically focus on the dominant (i.e., most impactful) term (i.e., <em>n</em> in this case, since <em>n</em> could be much larger than 2). In the real world, though, the fact of the matter is that <em>2n</em> feels twice as slow as <em>n</em>.</p><p>The challenge ahead of you is to implement the fastest spell checker you can! By “fastest,” though, we’re talking actual “wall-clock,” not asymptotic, time.</p><p>In <code>speller.c</code>, we’ve put together a program that’s designed to spell-check a file after loading a dictionary of words from disk into memory. That dictionary, meanwhile, is implemented in a file called <code>dictionary.c</code>. (It could just be implemented in <code>speller.c</code>, but as programs get more complex, it’s often convenient to break them into multiple files.) The prototypes for the functions therein, meanwhile, are defined not in <code>dictionary.c</code> itself but in <code>dictionary.h</code> instead. That way, both <code>speller.c</code> and <code>dictionary.c</code> can <code>#include</code> the file. Unfortunately, we didn’t quite get around to implementing the loading part. Or the checking part. Both (and a bit more) we leave to you! But first, a tour.</p><h4 id="dictionary-h"><a href="#dictionary-h" class="headerlink" title="dictionary.h"></a>dictionary.h</h4><p>Open up <code>dictionary.h</code>, and you’ll see some new syntax, including a few lines that mention <code>DICTIONARY_H</code>. No need to worry about those, but, if curious, those lines just ensure that, even though <code>dictionary.c</code> and <code>speller.c</code> (which you’ll see in a moment) <code>#include</code> this file, <code>clang</code> will only compile it once.</p><p>Next notice how we <code>#include</code> a file called <code>stdbool.h</code>. That’s the file in which <code>bool</code> itself is defined. You’ve not needed it before, since the CS50 Library used to <code>#include</code> that for you.</p><p>Also notice our use of <code>#define</code>, a “preprocessor directive” that defines a “constant” called <code>LENGTH</code> that has a value of <code>45</code>. It’s a constant in the sense that you can’t (accidentally) change it in your own code. In fact, <code>clang</code> will replace any mentions of <code>LENGTH</code> in your own code with, literally, <code>45</code>. In other words, it’s not a variable, just a find-and-replace trick.</p><p>Finally, notice the prototypes for five functions: <code>check</code>, <code>hash</code>, <code>load</code>, <code>size</code>, and <code>unload</code>. Notice how three of those take a pointer as an argument, per the <code>*</code>:</p><pre class="line-numbers language-c" data-language="c"><code class="language-c">bool <span class="token function">check</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token keyword">const</span> <span class="token keyword">char</span> <span class="token operator">*</span>word<span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span><span class="token keyword">unsigned</span> <span class="token keyword">int</span> <span class="token function">hash</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token keyword">const</span> <span class="token keyword">char</span> <span class="token operator">*</span>word<span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>bool <span class="token function">load</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token keyword">const</span> <span class="token keyword">char</span> <span class="token operator">*</span>dictionary<span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span><span aria-hidden="true" class="line-numbers-rows"><span></span><span></span><span></span></span></code></pre><p>Recall that <code>char *</code> is what we used to call <code>string</code>. So those three prototypes are essentially just:</p><pre class="line-numbers language-c" data-language="c"><code class="language-c">bool <span class="token function">check</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token keyword">const</span> string word<span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span><span class="token keyword">unsigned</span> <span class="token keyword">int</span> <span class="token function">hash</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token keyword">const</span> string word<span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>bool <span class="token function">load</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token keyword">const</span> string dictionary<span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span><span aria-hidden="true" class="line-numbers-rows"><span></span><span></span><span></span></span></code></pre><p>And <code>const</code>, meanwhile, just says that those strings, when passed in as arguments, must remain constant; you won’t be able to change them, accidentally or otherwise!</p><h4 id="dictionary-c"><a href="#dictionary-c" class="headerlink" title="dictionary.c"></a>dictionary.c</h4><p>Now open up <code>dictionary.c</code>. Notice how, atop the file, we’ve defined a <code>struct</code> called <code>node</code> that represents a node in a hash table. And we’ve declared a global pointer array, <code>table</code>, which will (soon) represent the hash table you will use to keep track of words in the dictionary. The array contains <code>N</code> node pointers, and we’ve set <code>N</code> equal to <code>26</code> for now, to match with the default <code>hash</code> function as described below. You will likely want to increase this depending on your own implementation of <code>hash</code>.</p><p>Next, notice that we’ve implemented <code>load</code>, <code>check</code>, <code>size</code>, and <code>unload</code>, but only barely, just enough for the code to compile. Notice too that we’ve implemented <code>hash</code> with a sample algorithm based on the first letter of the word. Your job, ultimately, is to re-implement those functions as cleverly as possible so that this spell checker works as advertised. And fast!</p><h4 id="speller-c"><a href="#speller-c" class="headerlink" title="speller.c"></a>speller.c</h4><p>Okay, next open up <code>speller.c</code> and spend some time looking over the code and comments therein. You won’t need to change anything in this file, and you don’t need to understand its entirety, but do try to get a sense of its functionality nonetheless. Notice how, by way of a function called <code>getrusage</code>, we’ll be “benchmarking” (i.e., timing the execution of) your implementations of <code>check</code>, <code>load</code>, <code>size</code>, and <code>unload</code>. Also notice how we go about passing <code>check</code>, word by word, the contents of some file to be spell-checked. Ultimately, we report each misspelling in that file along with a bunch of statistics.</p><p>Notice, incidentally, that we have defined the usage of <code>speller</code> to be</p><pre class="line-numbers language-bash" data-language="bash"><code class="language-bash">Usage: speller <span class="token punctuation">[</span>dictionary<span class="token punctuation">]</span> text<span aria-hidden="true" class="line-numbers-rows"><span></span></span></code></pre><p>where <code>dictionary</code> is assumed to be a file containing a list of lowercase words, one per line, and <code>text</code> is a file to be spell-checked. As the brackets suggest, provision of <code>dictionary</code> is optional; if this argument is omitted, <code>speller</code> will use <code>dictionaries/large</code> by default. In other words, running</p><pre class="line-numbers language-bash" data-language="bash"><code class="language-bash">./speller text<span aria-hidden="true" class="line-numbers-rows"><span></span></span></code></pre><p>will be equivalent to running</p><pre class="line-numbers language-bash" data-language="bash"><code class="language-bash">./speller dictionaries/large text<span aria-hidden="true" class="line-numbers-rows"><span></span></span></code></pre><p>where <code>text</code> is the file you wish to spell-check. Suffice it to say, the former is easier to type! (Of course, <code>speller</code> will not be able to load any dictionaries until you implement <code>load</code> in <code>dictionary.c</code>! Until then, you’ll see <code>Could not load</code>.)</p><p>Within the default dictionary, mind you, are 143,091 words, all of which must be loaded into memory! In fact, take a peek at that file to get a sense of its structure and size. Notice that every word in that file appears in lowercase (even, for simplicity, proper nouns and acronyms). From top to bottom, the file is sorted lexicographically, with only one word per line (each of which ends with <code>\n</code>). No word is longer than 45 characters, and no word appears more than once. During development, you may find it helpful to provide <code>speller</code> with a <code>dictionary</code> of your own that contains far fewer words, lest you struggle to debug an otherwise enormous structure in memory. In <code>dictionaries/small</code> is one such dictionary. To use it, execute</p><pre class="line-numbers language-none"><code class="language-none">./speller dictionaries/small text<span aria-hidden="true" class="line-numbers-rows"><span></span></span></code></pre><p>where <code>text</code> is the file you wish to spell-check. Don’t move on until you’re sure you understand how <code>speller</code> itself works!</p><p>Odds are, you didn’t spend enough time looking over <code>speller.c</code>. Go back one square and walk yourself through it again!</p><h4 id="texts-x2F"><a href="#texts-x2F" class="headerlink" title="texts/"></a>texts/</h4><p>So that you can test your implementation of <code>speller</code>, we’ve also provided you with a whole bunch of texts, among them the script from <em>La La Land</em>, the text of the Affordable Care Act, three million bytes from Tolstoy, some excerpts from <em>The Federalist Papers</em> and Shakespeare, and more. So that you know what to expect, open and skim each of those files, all of which are in a directory called <code>texts</code> within your <code>pset5</code> directory.</p><p>Now, as you should know from having read over <code>speller.c</code> carefully, the output of <code>speller</code>, if executed with, say,</p><pre class="line-numbers language-bash" data-language="bash"><code class="language-bash">./speller texts/lalaland.txt<span aria-hidden="true" class="line-numbers-rows"><span></span></span></code></pre><p>will eventually resemble the below.</p><p>Below’s some of the output you’ll see. For information’s sake, we’ve excerpted some examples of “misspellings.” And lest we spoil the fun, we’ve omitted our own statistics for now.</p><pre class="line-numbers language-none"><code class="language-none">MISSPELLED WORDS[...]AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHT[...]Shangri[...]fianc[...]Sebastian's[...]WORDS MISSPELLED:WORDS IN DICTIONARY:WORDS IN TEXT:TIME IN load:TIME IN check:TIME IN size:TIME IN unload:TIME IN TOTAL:<span aria-hidden="true" class="line-numbers-rows"><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span></span></code></pre><p><code>TIME IN load</code> represents the number of seconds that <code>speller</code> spends executing your implementation of <code>load</code>. <code>TIME IN check</code> represents the number of seconds that <code>speller</code> spends, in total, executing your implementation of <code>check</code>. <code>TIME IN size</code> represents the number of seconds that <code>speller</code> spends executing your implementation of <code>size</code>. <code>TIME IN unload</code> represents the number of seconds that <code>speller</code> spends executing your implementation of <code>unload</code>. <code>TIME IN TOTAL</code> is the sum of those four measurements.</p><p><strong>Note that these times may vary somewhat across executions of <code>speller</code>, depending on what else your codespace is doing, even if you don’t change your code.</strong></p><p>Incidentally, to be clear, by “misspelled” we simply mean that some word is not in the <code>dictionary</code> provided.</p><h4 id="Makefile"><a href="#Makefile" class="headerlink" title="Makefile"></a>Makefile</h4><p>And, lastly, recall that <code>make</code> automates compilation of your code so that you don’t have to execute <code>clang</code> manually along with a whole bunch of switches. However, as your programs grow in size, <code>make</code> won’t be able to infer from context anymore how to compile your code; you’ll need to start telling <code>make</code> how to compile your program, particularly when they involve multiple source (i.e., <code>.c</code>) files, as in the case of this problem. And so we’ll utilize a <code>Makefile</code>, a configuration file that tells <code>make</code> exactly what to do. Open up <code>Makefile</code>, and you should see four lines:</p><ol><li>The first line tells <code>make</code> to execute the subsequent lines whenever you yourself execute <code>make speller</code> (or just <code>make</code>).</li><li>The second line tells <code>make</code> how to compile <code>speller.c</code> into machine code (i.e., <code>speller.o</code>).</li><li>The third line tells <code>make</code> how to compile <code>dictionary.c</code> into machine code (i.e., <code>dictionary.o</code>).</li><li>The fourth line tells <code>make</code> to link <code>speller.o</code> and <code>dictionary.o</code> in a file called <code>speller</code>.</li></ol><p><strong>Be sure to compile <code>speller</code> by executing <code>make speller</code> (or just <code>make</code>). Executing <code>make dictionary</code> won’t work!</strong></p><h3 id="Specification"><a href="#Specification" class="headerlink" title="Specification"></a>Specification</h3><p>Alright, the challenge now before you is to implement, in order, <code>load</code>, <code>hash</code>, <code>size</code>, <code>check</code>, and <code>unload</code> as efficiently as possible using a hash table in such a way that <code>TIME IN load</code>, <code>TIME IN check</code>, <code>TIME IN size</code>, and <code>TIME IN unload</code> are all minimized. To be sure, it’s not obvious what it even means to be minimized, inasmuch as these benchmarks will certainly vary as you feed <code>speller</code> different values for <code>dictionary</code> and for <code>text</code>. But therein lies the challenge, if not the fun, of this problem. This problem is your chance to design. Although we invite you to minimize space, your ultimate enemy is time. But before you dive in, some specifications from us.</p><ul><li>You may not alter <code>speller.c</code> or <code>Makefile</code>.</li><li>You may alter <code>dictionary.c</code> (and, in fact, must in order to complete the implementations of <code>load</code>, <code>hash</code>, <code>size</code>, <code>check</code>, and <code>unload</code>), but you may not alter the declarations (i.e., prototypes) of <code>load</code>, <code>hash</code>, <code>size</code>, <code>check</code>, or <code>unload</code>. You may, though, add new functions and (local or global) variables to <code>dictionary.c</code>.</li><li>You may change the value of <code>N</code> in <code>dictionary.c</code>, so that your hash table can have more buckets.</li><li>You may alter <code>dictionary.h</code>, but you may not alter the declarations of <code>load</code>, <code>hash</code>, <code>size</code>, <code>check</code>, or <code>unload</code>.</li><li>Your implementation of <code>check</code> must be case-insensitive. In other words, if <code>foo</code> is in dictionary, then <code>check</code> should return true given any capitalization thereof; none of <code>foo</code>, <code>foO</code>, <code>fOo</code>, <code>fOO</code>, <code>fOO</code>, <code>Foo</code>, <code>FoO</code>, <code>FOo</code>, and <code>FOO</code> should be considered misspelled.</li><li>Capitalization aside, your implementation of <code>check</code> should only return <code>true</code> for words actually in <code>dictionary</code>. Beware hard-coding common words (e.g., <code>the</code>), lest we pass your implementation a <code>dictionary</code> without those same words. Moreover, the only possessives allowed are those actually in <code>dictionary</code>. In other words, even if <code>foo</code> is in <code>dictionary</code>, <code>check</code> should return <code>false</code> given <code>foo's</code> if <code>foo's</code> is not also in <code>dictionary</code>.</li><li>You may assume that any <code>dictionary</code> passed to your program will be structured exactly like ours, alphabetically sorted from top to bottom with one word per line, each of which ends with <code>\n</code>. You may also assume that <code>dictionary</code> will contain at least one word, that no word will be longer than <code>LENGTH</code> (a constant defined in <code>dictionary.h</code>) characters, that no word will appear more than once, that each word will contain only lowercase alphabetical characters and possibly apostrophes, and that no word will start with an apostrophe.</li><li>You may assume that <code>check</code> will only be passed words that contain (uppercase or lowercase) alphabetical characters and possibly apostrophes.</li><li>Your spell checker may only take <code>text</code> and, optionally, <code>dictionary</code> as input. Although you might be inclined (particularly if among those more comfortable) to “pre-process” our default dictionary in order to derive an “ideal hash function” for it, you may not save the output of any such pre-processing to disk in order to load it back into memory on subsequent runs of your spell checker in order to gain an advantage.</li><li>Your spell checker must not leak any memory. Be sure to check for leaks with <code>valgrind</code>.</li><li><strong>The hash function you write should ultimately be your own, not one you search for online.</strong> There are many ways to implement a hash function beyond using the first character (or characters) of a word. Consider a hash function that uses a sum of ASCII values or the length of a word. A good hash function tends to reduce “collisions” and has a fairly even distribution across hash table “buckets”.</li></ul><p>Alright, ready to go?</p><ul><li>Implement <code>load</code>.</li><li>Implement <code>hash</code>.</li><li>Implement <code>size</code>.</li><li>Implement <code>check</code>.</li><li>Implement <code>unload</code>.</li></ul><h3 id="Walkthroughs"><a href="#Walkthroughs" class="headerlink" title="Walkthroughs"></a>Walkthroughs</h3><blockquote><p><a href="https://youtu.be/_z57x5PGF4w">https://youtu.be/_z57x5PGF4w</a></p></blockquote><p>Note that there are 6 videos in the below playlist.</p><p>Though Speller’s walkthrough indicates it is reasonable to use a hash function found online, this video is from an older version of the problem where we allowed this. Per the specification above, the hash function you write should ultimately be your own; you <strong>may not</strong> use a hash function you find online. Be sure to cite any external sources you referenced in writing your hash function.</p><h3 id="Hints"><a href="#Hints" class="headerlink" title="Hints"></a>Hints</h3><p>To compare two strings case-insensitively, you may find <a href="https://man.cs50.io/3/strcasecmp"><code>strcasecmp</code></a> (declared in <code>strings.h</code>) useful! You’ll likely also want to ensure that your hash function is case-insensitive, such that <code>foo</code> and <code>FOO</code> have the same hash value.</p><p>Ultimately, be sure to <code>free</code> in <code>unload</code> any memory that you allocated in <code>load</code>! Recall that <code>valgrind</code> is your newest best friend. Know that <code>valgrind</code> watches for leaks while your program is actually running, so be sure to provide command-line arguments if you want <code>valgrind</code> to analyze <code>speller</code> while you use a particular <code>dictionary</code> and/or text, as in the below. Best to use a small text, though, else <code>valgrind</code> could take quite a while to run.</p><pre class="line-numbers language-bash" data-language="bash"><code class="language-bash">valgrind ./speller texts/cat.txt<span aria-hidden="true" class="line-numbers-rows"><span></span></span></code></pre><p>If you run <code>valgrind</code> without specifying a <code>text</code> for <code>speller</code>, your implementations of <code>load</code> and <code>unload</code> won’t actually get called (and thus analyzed).</p><p>If unsure how to interpret the output of <code>valgrind</code>, do just ask <code>help50</code> for help:</p><pre class="line-numbers language-bash" data-language="bash"><code class="language-bash">help50 valgrind ./speller texts/cat.txt<span aria-hidden="true" class="line-numbers-rows"><span></span></span></code></pre><h3 id="Testing"><a href="#Testing" class="headerlink" title="Testing"></a>Testing</h3><p>How to check whether your program is outting the right misspelled words? Well, you’re welcome to consult the “answer keys” that are inside of the <code>keys</code> directory that’s inside of your <code>speller</code> directory. For instance, inside of <code>keys/lalaland.txt</code> are all of the words that your program <em>should</em> think are misspelled.</p><p>You could therefore run your program on some text in one window, as with the below.</p><pre class="line-numbers language-bash" data-language="bash"><code class="language-bash">./speller texts/lalaland.txt<span aria-hidden="true" class="line-numbers-rows"><span></span></span></code></pre><p>And you could then run the staff’s solution on the same text in another window, as with the below.</p><pre class="line-numbers language-bash" data-language="bash"><code class="language-bash">./speller50 texts/lalaland.txt<span aria-hidden="true" class="line-numbers-rows"><span></span></span></code></pre><p>And you could then compare the windows visually side by side.

Each person also has an array of two <code>alleles</code>, each of which is a <code>char</code> (either <code>'A'</code>, <code>'B'</code>, or <code>'O'</code>).</p><p>Now, take a look at the <code>main</code> function. The function begins by “seeding” (i.e., providing some initial input to) a random number generator, which we’ll use later to generate random alleles. The <code>main</code> function then calls the <code>create_family</code> function to simulate the creation of <code>person</code> structs for a family of 3 generations (i.e. a person, their parents, and their grandparents). We then call <code>print_family</code> to print out each of those family members and their blood types. Finally, the function calls <code>free_family</code> to <code>free</code> any memory that was previously allocated with <code>malloc</code>.</p><p>The <code>create_family</code> and <code>free_family</code> functions are left to you to write!</p><h2 id="Implementation-Details-📚"><a href="#Implementation-Details-📚" class="headerlink" title="Implementation Details 📚"></a>Implementation Details 📚</h2><p>Complete the implementation of <code>inheritance.c</code>, such that it creates a family of a specified generation size and assigns blood type alleles to each family member. The oldest generation will have alleles assigned randomly to them.</p><ul><li>The <code>create_family</code> function takes an integer (<code>generations</code>) as input and should allocate (as via <code>malloc</code> ) one <code>person</code> for each member of the family of that number of generations, returning a pointer to the <code>person</code> in the youngest generation.<ul><li>For example, <code>create_family(3)</code> should return a pointer to a person with two parents, where each parent also has two parents.</li><li>Each <code>person</code> should have <code>alleles</code> assigned to them. The oldest generation should have alleles randomly chosen (as by calling the <code>random_allele</code> function), and younger generations should inherit one allele (chosen at random) from each parent.</li><li>Each <code>person</code> should have <code>parents</code> assigned to them. The oldest generation should have both <code>parents</code> set to <code>NULL</code>, and younger generations should have <code>parents</code> be an array of two pointers, each pointing to a different parent.</li></ul></li></ul><p>We’ve divided the <code>create_family</code> function into a few <code>TODO</code>s for you to complete.</p><ul><li>First, you should allocate memory for a new person. Recall that you can use <code>malloc</code> to allocate memory, and <code>sizeof(person)</code> to get the number of bytes to allocate.</li><li>Next, we’ve included a condition to check if <code>generations &gt; 1</code>.<ul><li>If <code>generations &gt; 1</code>, then there are more generations that still need to be allocated. We’ve already created two new <code>parents</code>, <code>parent0</code> and <code>parent1</code>, by recursively calling <code>create_family</code>. Your <code>create_family</code> function should then set the parent pointers of the new person you created. Finally, assign both <code>alleles</code> for the new person by randomly choosing one allele from each parent.</li><li>Otherwise (if <code>generations == 1</code>), then there will be no parent data for this person. Both <code>parents</code> of your new person should be set to <code>NULL</code>, and each <code>allele</code> should be generated randomly.</li></ul></li><li>Finally, your function should return a pointer for the <code>person</code> that was allocated.</li></ul><p>The <code>free_family</code> function should accept as input a pointer to a <code>person</code>, free memory for that person, and then recursively free memory for all of their ancestors.</p><ul><li>Since this is a recursive function, you should first handle the base case. If the input to the function is <code>NULL</code>, then there’s nothing to free, so your function can return immediately.</li><li>Otherwise, you should recursively <code>free</code> both of the person’s parents before <code>free</code>ing the child.</li></ul><h2 id="Walkthrough-🎥"><a href="#Walkthrough-🎥" class="headerlink" title="Walkthrough 🎥"></a>Walkthrough 🎥</h2><p>This video was recorded when the course was still using CS50 IDE for writing code.

脚本）</strong> 是一种由 <strong>Bash shell</strong> 编写的脚本文件，可以 <strong>自动化地执行一系列命令</strong>。</p><p>Bash 脚本通常以 <code>.sh</code> 为文件扩展名，可以通过命令行终端或者其它脚本来执行。</p><p>Bash 脚本通常由一系列的命令和逻辑语句组成，可以包括循环、条件语句、函数、变量等。</p><p>Bash 脚本可以用于自动化各种任务，例如批量处理文件、执行系统命令、备份数据、部署应用程序等等。因为Bash脚本是文本文件，所以可以通过编辑器来编写和修改，也可以被版本控制系统管理。</p><h2 id="Bash-Script-实践🧑🏻‍💻"><a href="#Bash-Script-实践🧑🏻‍💻"

解释器来执行脚本。</p><p>在本实例中，<code>#!/bin/bash</code> 指定了要使用 Bash shell 来执行该脚本。这意味着，当这个脚本被执行时，操作系统会自动查找 Bash 解释器的位置，然后使用 Bash 解释器来解释并执行这个脚本文件。</p><blockquote><p>在使用 Bash 编写脚本时，始终将 <code>#!/bin/bash</code> 作为脚本的开头部分是一个很好的习惯，以确保脚本可以正确地被执行。</p></blockquote><hr><h3 id="3-优化（引入变量）"><a href="#3-优化（引入变量）" class="headerlink" title="3. 优化（引入变量）"></a>3. 优化（引入变量）</h3><ol><li>使用变量</li></ol><pre class="line-numbers

These files contain <code>n</code> lines of values, either reversed, shuffled, or sorted.<ul><li>For example, <code>reversed10000.txt</code> contains 10000 lines of numbers that are reversed from <code>10000</code>, while <code>random10000.txt</code> contains 10000 lines of numbers that are in random order.</li></ul></li><li>To run the sorts on the text files, in the terminal, run <code>./[program_name] [text_file.txt]</code> . Make sure you have made use of <code>cd</code> to move into the <code>sort</code> directory!<ul><li>For example, to sort <code>reversed10000.txt</code> with <code>sort1</code>, run <code>./sort1 reversed10000.txt</code>.</li></ul></li><li>You may find it helpful to time your sorts. To do so, run <code>time ./[sort_file] [text_file.txt]</code>.<ul><li>For example, you could run <code>time ./sort1 reversed10000.txt</code> to run <code>sort1</code> on 10,000 reversed numbers. At the end of your terminal’s output, you can look at the <code>real</code> time to see how much time actually elapsed while running the program.</li></ul></li><li>Record your answers in <code>answers.txt</code>, along with an explanation for each program, by filling in the blanks marked <code>TODO</code>.</li></ul><h2 id="Hints-💡"><a href="#Hints-💡" class="headerlink" title="Hints 💡"></a>Hints 💡</h2><ul><li>The different types of <code>.txt</code> files may help you determine which sort is which. Consider how each algorithm performs with an already sorted list. How about a reversed list? Or shuffled list? It may help to work through a smaller list of each type and walk through each sorting process.</li></ul><h2 id="Walkthrough-🎥"><a href="#Walkthrough-🎥" class="headerlink" title="Walkthrough 🎥"></a>Walkthrough 🎥</h2><blockquote><p>YouTube: <a href="https://youtu.be/-Bhxxw6JKKY">https://youtu.be/-Bhxxw6JKKY</a></p><p>bilibili: <a href="https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1pX4y1B7cj?share_source=copy_web">https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1pX4y1B7cj?share_source=copy_web</a></p></blockquote><h2 id="How-to-Check-Your-Answers-🖥"><a href="#How-to-Check-Your-Answers-🖥" class="headerlink" title="How to Check Your Answers 🖥"></a>How to Check Your Answers 🖥</h2><p>Execute the below to evaluate the correctness of your answers using <code>check50</code>.

Each year, <code>n / 3</code> new llamas are born, and <code>n / 4</code> llamas pass away.</p><p>For example, if we were to start with <code>n = 1200</code> llamas, then in the first year, <code>1200 / 3 = 400</code> new llamas would be born and <code>1200 / 4 = 300</code> llamas would pass away. At the end of that year, we would have <code>1200 + 400 - 300 = 1300</code> llamas.</p><p>To try another example, if we were to start with <code>n = 1000</code> llamas, at the end of the year, we would have <code>1000 / 3 = 333.33</code> new llamas. We can’t have a decimal portion of a llama, though, so we’ll truncate the decimal to get <code>333</code> new llamas born. <code>1000 / 4 = 250</code> llamas will pass away, so we’ll end up with a total of <code>1000 + 333 - 250 = 1083</code> llamas at the end of the year.</p><h2 id="Getting-Started-🍉"><a href="#Getting-Started-🍉" class="headerlink" title="Getting Started 🍉"></a>Getting Started 🍉</h2><p>Recall that Visual Studio Code (aka VS Code) is a popular “integrated development environment” (IDE) via which you can write code. So that you don’t have to download, install, and configure your own copy of VS Code, we’ll use a cloud-based version instead that has everything you’ll need pre-installed.</p><ol><li>Log into <a href="https://code.cs50.io/">code.cs50.io</a> using your GitHub account and follow the on-screen instructions to set up your very own “codespace” for Visual Studio Code. Once your codespace loads, you should see that, by default, VS Code is divided into three regions. Toward the top of VS Code is your “text editor,” where you’ll write all of your programs. Toward the bottom is a “terminal window,” a command-line interface (CLI) that allows you to explore your codespace’s files and directories (aka folders), compile code, and run programs. And on the left is your file “explorer,” a graphical user interface (GUI) via which you can also explore your codespace’s files and directories.</li><li>Once your codespace has loaded, close any <strong>Welcome</strong> tabs that might have opened by default</li><li>Log into <a href="https://submit.cs50.io/">submit.cs50.io</a> using your GitHub account and click <strong>Authorize cs50</strong> to activate <code>check50</code>.</li><li>Run <code>update50</code> in your codespace’s terminal window to ensure your codespace is up-to-date and, if prompted, click <strong>Rebuild now</strong>.</li></ol><p>Once complete, start by clicking inside your terminal window, then execute <code>cd</code> by itself. You should find that its “prompt” resembles the below.</p><pre class="line-numbers language-bash" data-language="bash"><code class="language-bash">$<span aria-hidden="true" class="line-numbers-rows"><span></span></span></code></pre><p>Click inside of that terminal window and then type</p><pre class="line-numbers language-bash" data-language="bash"><code class="language-bash"><span class="token function">mkdir</span> population<span aria-hidden="true" class="line-numbers-rows"><span></span></span></code></pre><p>followed by Enter in order to make a directory called <code>population</code> in your codespace. Take care not to overlook the space between <code>mkdir</code> and <code>population</code> or any other character for that matter!</p><p>Here on out, to execute (i.e., run) a command means to type it into a terminal window and then hit Enter. Commands are case-sensitive, so be sure not to type in uppercase when you mean lowercase or vice versa.</p><p>Now execute</p><pre class="line-numbers language-bash" data-language="bash"><code class="language-bash"><span class="token builtin class-name">cd</span> population<span aria-hidden="true" class="line-numbers-rows"><span></span></span></code></pre><p>to move yourself into (i.e., open) that directory.

href="#Python-2" class="headerlink" title="Python"></a>Python</h4><p>Python 中没有像 C 语言中的 <code>main</code> 函数那样的入口函数，整个 Python 脚本都是可执行的。</p><p>但是，<strong>为了方便编写测试代码和模块化编程</strong>，Python 提供了一种 <strong>判断当前脚本是否作为主程序执行</strong> 的方式，即通过判断 <code>__name__</code> 变量的值是否为 <code>"__main__"</code>。</p><ul><li>当 Python 脚本作为主程序执行时，<code>__name__</code> 的值会被设置为 <code>"__main__"</code></li><li>当 Python 脚本作为模块被导入时，<code>__name__</code> 的值会被设置为模块的名称。</li></ul><p>这个特性可以让我们在 Python 脚本中编写一些测试代码，但不会影响到被导入的代码。</p><p>通常，在 Python 脚本的末尾会使用以下代码来判断当前脚本是否作为主程序执行：</p><pre class="line-numbers language-python" data-language="python"><code class="language-python"><span class="token keyword">if</span> __name__ <span class="token operator">==</span> <span class="token string">"__main__"</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span>    <span class="token comment"># 在这里编写主程序</span><span aria-hidden="true" class="line-numbers-rows"><span></span><span></span></span></code></pre><p>在这个代码块中，我们可以编写 Python 脚本的主要逻辑。当我们在命令行中执行这个脚本时，就会执行这个代码块中的代码。例如，下面是一个简单的 Python 脚本示例：</p><pre class="line-numbers language-python" data-language="python"><code class="language-python"><span class="token keyword">def</span> <span class="token function">say_hello</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span>    <span

class="token punctuation">)</span><span aria-hidden="true" class="line-numbers-rows"><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span></span></code></pre><p>当我们在命令行中执行这个脚本时，将会输出 <code>"Hello, World!"</code>；而如果我们将这个脚本作为模块导入到其他脚本中时，<code>say_hello</code> 函数不会被执行。</p><hr><h3 id="基本数据类型"><a href="#基本数据类型" class="headerlink" title="基本数据类型"></a>基本数据类型</h3><h4 id="C-x2F-C"><a

<code>f[n]</code> 可以拆分成 3 个独立的部分：</p><ul><li><strong>最后一步</strong> 向 <strong>左</strong> 走的路线数 <code>l[n]</code></li><li><strong>最后一步</strong> 向 <strong>右</strong> 走的路线数 <code>r[n]</code></li><li><strong>最后一步</strong> 向 <strong>上</strong> 走的路线数 <code>u[n]</code></li></ul><p>即 <code>f[n] = l[n] + r[n] + u[n]</code> ，所以我们可以通过计算 <code>l[n], r[n], u[n]</code> 来得到 <code>f[n]</code></p><p>而对于 <code>l[n]，r[n], u[n]</code> ，我们可以由 <code>f[n - 1]</code> 来推断。</p><br><p>按照我们的假设， <code>f[n-1]</code> 表示 走 n-1 步的不同路线总数，由于这里面的每条路线都是不同的，所以在这些路线的基础上，再往左走 1 步，得到的路线也都是不同的，就有 <code>l[n] = f[n-1]</code> ❌ </p><p>但是我们知道 <strong>并不是所有路线，都能再往左走的</strong>。在所有走 n -1 步的路线中，如果第 <strong>n - 1步是往右走的</strong>，就 <strong>没有办法在第 n 步的时候往左走的</strong>，因为左边的方格塌陷了。</p><p>所以 <strong>只有第 n - 1步往左走，或者往上走的路线</strong>，才能在第 n 步时，往左走。</p><p>而 所有 <strong>n -1步 往左走</strong>的路线数量，按照我们的假设，就等于 <code>l[n-1]</code>；所有 n -1步 <strong>往上走</strong>的路线数量，按照我们的假设，就等于 <code>u[n-1]</code> 。所以 <code>l[n] = l[n - 1] + u[n-1]</code> ✅</p><p>同理，<code>r[n] = r[n-1] + u[n-1]</code> ✅ </p><p><code>u[n]</code> 比较特殊，因为 n-1 步往左、往右的路线在走第 n 步时，均可以向上走，所以 <code>u[n] = l[n-1] + r[n-1] + u[n-1]=f[n-1]</code> ✅ </p><p>边界条件很好确定，<code>l[1] = r[1] = u[1] = 1</code>，因此就可以由递推关系，推出 <code>l[2],l[3], ... ,l[n]</code>，同理推出 <code>r[2],r[3], ... ,r[n]</code> 和 <code>u[2],u[3], ... ,u[n]</code> 🎉</p><p>最后再计算，$f[n] = l[n] + r[n] + u[n]$ 即可得到答案。</p><blockquote><p>本题还可以简化，不过该简化式一下子不容易想到，需要用一些数学知识，推导如下：</p><p>$f[n]$</p><p>$= l[n] + r[n] + u[n]$</p><p>$= 2 * l[n -1] + 2 * r[n-1] + 3 * u[n-1]$</p><p>$= 2 * f[n-1] + u[n-1]$</p><p>$= 2 * f[n-1] + u[n-2] + l[n -2] + r[n - 2]$</p><p>$= 2 * f[n-1] + f[n-2]$</p><p>即递推式为 $f[n] = 2 * f[n - 1] + f[n-2](n \ge 3)$</p></blockquote><p>🍉 总结：该题从 <strong>不同路线</strong> 和 <strong>路线的第 n 步和 n-1 步方向</strong> 角度去展开递推，会比较清晰明了（不建议像「单点移动路线」问题那样从某个点开始考虑）</p><hr><h2 id="🧑🏻‍💻-C-代码"><a href="#🧑🏻‍💻-C-代码" class="headerlink" title="🧑🏻‍💻 C++ 代码"></a>🧑🏻‍💻 C++ 代码</h2><p>标准版</p><pre

题解分析</h2><p>本题是「<strong>单点移动路线方案数</strong>」问题的经典题目之一，在上题「<strong>移动路线</strong>」的基础上，增加了障碍点的条件。（「移动路线」 题目链接：<a

href="https://rickyxcoder.gitee.io/2023/04/09/xin-xi-ao-sai-ti-jie-yi-dong-lu-xian/">信息奥赛题解｜移动路线</a>）</p><p>我们只需要额外设置一个状态数组 <code>vis</code>，存储某个点是否为障碍点即可，剩下的思路和上题一致。</p><p>🍉 代码精简小提示 ：</p><ul><li>本题可以用两个数组，存储马可能跳的点的横坐标/纵坐标变化值，这样只需要循环一次，就能把所有马能跳到的障碍点的 <code>vis</code> 值置为 1</li><li>题目中起点是从 $(0,0)$ 开始，而传统的「<strong>移动路线</strong>」问题是从 $(1,1)$ 开始，所以可以在坐标读入的时候全部 <code>+1</code>。但是由于本题在计算马的坐标时，可能遇到 <code>-2</code> 越界的问题，所以干脆整体 <code>+2</code>，起点从 $(2,2)$ 开始，会精简不少代码。</li></ul><hr><h2 id="🧑🏻‍💻-C-代码"><a href="#🧑🏻‍💻-C-代码" class="headerlink" title="🧑🏻‍💻 C++

$(1,1)$，则右上角方格的坐标为 $(m,n)$。</p><p>小明是个调皮的孩子，一天他捉来一只蚂蚁，不小心把蚂蚁的右脚弄伤了，于是蚂蚁只能向上或向右移动。小明把这只蚂蚁放在左下角的方格中，蚂蚁从左下角的方格中移动到右上角的方格中，每步移动一个方格。蚂蚁始终在方格矩阵内移动，请计算出不同的移动路线的数目。</p><p>对于 $1$ 行 $1$ 列的方格矩阵，蚂蚁原地移动，移动路线数为 $1$；对于 $1$ 行 $2$ 列（或 $2$ 行 $1$ 列）的方格矩阵，蚂蚁只需一次向右（或向上）移动，移动路线数也为 $1$</p><p>对于一个 $2$ 行 $3$ 列的方格矩阵，如下图所示：</p><p>$(2,1),(2,2),(2,3)$</p><p>$(1,1),(1,2),(1,3)$</p><p>蚂蚁共有3种移动路线：</p><p>路线1：$(1,1) → (1,2) →

题解分析</h2><p>本题是求 <strong>到达某点路线方案数</strong> 中较为基础的题型，是典型的递推问题。</p><p>可以构造一个二维矩阵 <code>a[N][N]</code> 表示总地图，其中 <code>a[i][j]</code> 表示从起点到点 $(i,j)$  的路线方案数。</p><p>由于蚂蚁只能往上或者往右走，因此对于每一个点 <code>a[i][j]</code> 来说，只能从下面的点 <code>a[i-1][j]</code> 或者左边的点 <code>a[i][j-1]</code> 走到，所以到 <code>a[i][j]</code> 的方案数就是从 起点到 <code>a[i-1][j]</code> 和 起点<code>a[i][j-1]</code> 的方案数之和，即递推关系为 <code>a[i][j] = a[i-1][j] + a[i][j-1]</code></p><p>本题数组 <code>a</code> 推荐使用全局变量（全局变量默认初始值为 0），这样在 <code>i = 1</code> 或者 <code>j = 1</code> 时（边界情况下），该方程仍然成立。</p><ul><li>如起点为 $(1,1)$，想要到点 $(1,2)$ ，只有向右走一种方式，即 <code>a[1][2] = a[1][1] = 1</code> ，但是由于点 <code>a[0][2]</code> 在全局变量的情况下，默认值为 0，所以把方程写成 <code>a[1][2] = a[1][1] + a[0][2] = 1</code> 也是完全可以的。</li><li>这样的写法会简化代码，因为不用单独判断最下面一行和最左边一列了。</li></ul><p>❗️ 但是在初始化时要注意给 <code>a[1][1]</code> 单独赋值为 1，否则在递推计算时，所有结果均为0。（请思考为什么会这样？）</p><hr><h2 id="🧑🏻‍💻-C-代码"><a href="#🧑🏻‍💻-C-代码"

日（考完蓝桥杯的晚上），摊主想要把这篇文章上传至自己的博客网站，于是再次阅读了这篇寒假写的复盘，打算检查文章可能存在的错误。</p><p>在检查的过程中，摊主突然发现 C 题又不会做了，说明当时还是没有理解透彻，需要回炉重造。😂</p><p>回顾一下自己晚上的做题流程：</p><ul><li>一开始打算用贪心去解，即优先删去最大值，但是样例3这样的序列显然无法这样简单的贪心。</li><li>然后发现可以把无序的序列，进行升序排列，更加直观。</li><li>想到使用 <strong>线性DP</strong> 求解，但是始终无法推出状态转移方程，或者说究竟如何表示状态？<ul><li>自己模拟的序列是这样的 <code>1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 3 3 3</code></li><li>DP 考虑如下<ul><li><code>dp[i]</code> 表示删去第 <code>i</code> 个数字后（一定要删去第 <code>i</code> 个数字），能得到的最大值</li><li><code>dp[i]</code> 表示 <code>1~i</code> 序列能得到的最大值（不一定删去第 <code>i</code> 个数字）</li></ul></li><li>但是在考虑上面两种情况是，总是会遇到 <strong>无法往下思考的点</strong>（这种状态在题目难时经常出现），有时候情况有点杂，自己就开始理不清了。<ul><li>比如第 1 种情况，如果一定删去第 <code>i</code> 个数字 <code>a[i]</code>，那这时候如何删除前面所有的 <code>a[i]-1</code>？状态好像没办法转移过来，或者说需要记录一连串数字的左右下标，感觉有点麻烦。（其实这里就应当考虑到，如果把一连串数字进行合并，会不会简单些）</li><li>再如第 2 种情况，那就需要讨论是否删除第 <code>i</code> 个数字，但是这样也需要讨论：比如 <code>1 1 1 2</code> ，执行到 2 时，如果删了 2，<code>dp[4] = 2</code>，不删 2 的话， <code>dp[4] = 3</code>，取两者最大值 → <code>dp[4] = 3</code>。但是假如在后面再添一个 <code>2</code>，我们一眼能看出来 <code>dp[5] = 4</code>，但是落实到具体方程时，<code>dp[5]=dp[4]+2=5</code>，显然有问题，因为这时候 <code>dp[4]</code> 应该为 2，出现了前后矛盾。</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>最后只能遗憾告终</li></ul><p>于是又去温习了一遍 y总的讲解，发现一开始 y总直接把 <code>1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 3 3 3</code> 这种合并成了 <code>1 2 3</code>，就直接对 3 个数值进行 线性DP，省去了记录一连串数字的左右下标。（这里有一步贪心过程，如想要删除数字 2，一定是把 5 个 2 都删除）</p><p>然后 <code>dp[i]</code> 的表示是选择了上面线性DP的第二种方案，思路如下：</p><ul><li>序列 <code>1 2 ... i</code>，这里 <code>i</code> 并非下标，而是原序列中出现的值<ul><li>如果不选数字 <code>i</code>，则 <code>dp[i] = dp[i-1]</code></li><li>如果选择数字 <code>i</code>，则 <code>dp[i] = dp[i-2] + s[i]</code></li><li>取两者最大值即可。</li><li>注意 🍉：由于状态转移方程中出现了 <code>i-2</code>，所以为了防止下标越界，循环需要从 2 开始；或者写成这种形式 <code>dp[max(0,i-2)]</code></li></ul></li></ul><p>这里非常精妙的对数值进行线性DP，而不是像很多模型那样对下标进行线性DP（有点像「二分答案」那样）</p><p>只能说 DP 的题目思路都太精妙了，只有多看，多学，多练，才能让自己「顿悟」，继续加油。</p><h4 id="【复盘后的优化代码】✅-2"><a

- 2 + 2 = 4$</p><table><thead><tr><th align="center">月份</th><th align="center">0月</th><th align="center">1月</th><th align="center">2月</th><th align="center">3月</th><th

对卵，已经有 2 对在 3 月份变成了成虫，实际上只有 2 对卵在 4 月份变成了成虫，正确的 $c[4] = c[3] + 2 = 6$ 才对。🤔</p><p>经过思考，我们发现上面公式里的 <code>r[i-2]</code>，<strong>不应该设成 2 个月前卵的总数量</strong>，因为如果是总数量，那么这些卵中有一部分来自于上个月，这部分卵在下一个月就会变成成虫，而不是等 2 个月后才变成成虫。💡</p><p>所以，更加合理的表示方式，应该是将「<strong>r 数组设置为每个月新增的卵的数量</strong>」。即每个月的成虫总数量 <code>c[i]</code>，应该等于 上个月成虫的总数量 <code>c[i-1]</code> + 上 2 个月新增的卵的数量 <code>r[i-2]</code>（其他时间产生的卵和 <code>c[i]</code> 的计算并没有关系）✅ </p><p>这也是为什么很多题解中，选择设置 <strong>c为每月成虫总数量</strong>，但是 <strong>r 为每月<u><em>新增</em></u> 的卵的数量</strong>的原因。</p><p>这样设定变量含义，就能够得到正确的递推方程：<br>$$<br>c[i] = c[i - 1] + r[i - 2] ; r[i] = c[i -x] * y<br>$$<br>递推方程含义为（在 x 个月之后）：</p><p>每月成虫总数量 $c[i]$ = 上一个月成虫总数量 $c[i -1]$ + 上 2 个月新增的卵的数量 $r[i - 2]$</p><p>每月新增的卵的数量 $r[i]$ = 上 x 个月的成虫总数量 $c[i-x] * y$</p><p>在理解了这一步后，我们再重新来推一下这个表格：</p><p>在 <code>0 - x-1</code> 月，第一对成虫不产卵，$c[i] \equiv  1,r[i] \equiv 0$，即：</p><ul><li>在第 0 月时，$c[0] = 1,r[0] = 0$</li></ul><table><thead><tr><th align="center">月份</th><th align="center">0月</th><th

</p><br><p>在梳理完了递推关系后，我们尝试书写代码（这题对于初学者来说确实麻烦，但是 <strong>对逻辑思维是很好的锻炼</strong>）</p><p>我们从上面的过程入手，<strong>边界条件</strong> 就比较容易确定。显然，总过程分为 3 段，分别是 <code>0-x-1</code>月, <code>x</code>月, <code>x+1-z</code>

🎉🎉🎉）</p><p>其实，在对 $x$ 月的赋值时，也可以将其合并到第 3 段，但是这个合并操作要求 x &gt; 1（因为第 3 段的 递推方程中包含 <code>r[i - 2]</code>，所以需要保证 <code>i - 2 &gt; 0</code>）。为了代码逻辑更加清晰，博主采用了 3 段式。</p><p>当然，博主也看到有代码是月份从 1 开始的，这样的话，「过了 z 个月」就是 z + 1 月，最终输出的答案是 c[z + 1]，这样从 1 开始的下标就可以保证 2、3 段合并时 $i - 2 &gt; 0$ 了，也是可以的。</p><p>在本文中，博主选择月份下标从 0 开始，这样「过了 z 个月」就是 z 月，比较容易记忆，大伙可以根据喜好自行选择。</p><p>🍉 PS：本题需要使用 <code>long long</code> 类型，<code>int</code> 类型不够用。</p><hr><h2 id="🧑🏻‍💻-C-代码"><a href="#🧑🏻‍💻-C-代码" class="headerlink" title="🧑🏻‍💻 C++ 代码"></a>🧑🏻‍💻 C++ 代码</h2><pre class="line-numbers language-cpp" data-language="cpp"><code

题解分析</h2><p>爬楼梯问题也是 <strong>递推思想</strong> 的典型体现。</p><p>我们可以把走到第 <code>i</code> 级楼梯的方案数 <code>f[i]</code>  看成 <strong>一个集合</strong>，由「最后一步走 1 级楼梯的方案数 <code>f[i-1]</code> 」和 「最后一步走 2 级楼梯的方案数 <code>f[i-2]</code> 」这 <strong>两个子集</strong> 构成。</p><p>比如走到第 <code>5</code> 级楼梯的方案数 <code>f[5]</code> ，按照最后一步走的级数可以分为以下两个子集：</p><ul><li>最后一步走 1 级，那么走最后一步之前，我们处在第 4 级台阶，所以这个子集的大小为 <code>f[4]</code></li><li>最后一步走 2 级，那么走最后一步之前，我们处在第 3 级台阶，所以这个子集的大小为 <code>f[3]</code></li></ul><p>这样的分割方法做到了 <strong>不重复、不遗漏</strong>，因此只需按照方程 <code>f[i] = f[i-1] + f[i-2]</code> 去递推即可。</p><h2 id="❗️-误区提示"><a href="#❗️-误区提示" class="headerlink" title="❗️ 误区提示"></a>❗️ 误区提示</h2><p>此题的一个 <strong>常见错误</strong>，就是把递推方程书写成 <code>f[i] = f[i-1] + 2*f[i-2]</code>。</p><p>这是因为在划分子集时，把第二个子集「<strong>最后一步走 2 级</strong>」✅ 误解成了「<strong>最后一步走 2 级有多少种方案</strong>」❌</p><p>这就导致在考虑 <code>f[i-2]</code> 时，认为 <strong>最后一步走 2 级有 2 种方案</strong>：即一次走 2 级，或先走 1 级，再走 1 级。把 <code>f[i-2]</code> 与 <code>f[2]</code> 产生了联系，所以在 <code>f[i-2]</code> 前乘了 2。❌ </p><p>但是仔细思考，我们会发现上面这种错误的想法，<strong>本质上是因为两个子集出现了重复</strong>。</p><p> 「最后一步走 2 级，但是每次走 1 级」的方案，其实是包含在第一个子集 「最后一步走 1 级」中的。因为如果先走 1 级，再走 1 级，那最后一步就是 1 级，根本不能划分在「最后一步走 2 级」这个子集中，从而产生了错误。</p><p>也就是说，<code>f[i-2]</code> 与 <code>f[2]</code> 是没有关系的❗️</p><p>初学者在初学时犯了这种错误后，需要仔细思考原因，避免下次再走入这个误区。🍀</p><hr><h2

是否在容器中，若有，则有解。</li></ol><p>🍉 PS1：使用 <code>vector</code> 会超时，因为在 <code>vector</code> 中查找元素，时间复杂度为 $O(N)$；而在 <code>set、map</code> 中，查找的时间复杂度为 $O(logN)$，时间会大大降低。</p><p>🍉 PS2：本题数据上限很大，已经超出了 <code>int</code> 类型的范围，需要使用 <code>long long</code> 类型。（ <code>1ll</code> 是 1 的 <code>long long</code> 形式，<code>任何 int 类型数据 * 1ll</code> 后均能转换为 <code>long long</code> 类型）</p><h4 id="【-C-代码】-1"><a
